# MicroEconomics:
-  *Microeconomics* focuses in the individual parts of the economy
	-  How households and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets

### Topics:

- Understanding trade-offs and opportunity costs
-  Demand, Supply: Its nature, elasticity and its determinants
-  Putting demand and supply together: An understanding of markets
-  Competition, monopoly and oligopoly
-  Government Policy
-  Some first principles

###### *. . . The word economy comes from a Greek word for "one who manages a household".*

### Ten Principles of Economics:
###### *Economics* is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.
**How People make Decisions:**
-  People face trade-offs
-  The cost of something is what you give up to get it
-  Rational people think at the margin
-  People respond to incentives
**How People Interact:**
-  Trade can make everyone better off
-  Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
-  Governments can sometimes improve economic outcomes
-  A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.
-  Growth of money leads to inflation
-  Society faces a short-run tradeoff between Inflation and Unemployment

##### Principle #1 : People Face Trade-offs.
-  There is no such thing as a "free lunch"
-  To get one thing, we usually have to give up another thing.
	-  Guns v. butter
	-  Food v. clothing
	-  Leisure time v. work
	-  Efficiency v. equity
-  **Efficiency v. Equity**
	-  *Efficiency* means society gets the most that it can from its scarce resources
	-  *Equity* means the benefits of those resources are distributed fairly among the members of society

##### Principle #2 : The Cost of something is What you give up to get it
-  Decisions require comparing costs and benefits of alternatives.
	-  Whether to go to college or work ?
	-  Whether to study or go out on a date ?
	-  Whether to go to class or sleep in ?
-  The *opportunity cost* of an item is what you give up to obtain that item.

##### Principle #3 : Rational people think at the margin
-  *Marginal changes* are small, incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action
-  People make decisions by comparing costs and benefits at the margin

##### Principle #4 : People Respond to Incentives
-  Marginal changes in costs or benefits motivate people to respond
-  The decision to choose one alternative over another occurs when that alternative's marginal benefits exceed its marginal costs

##### Principle #5 : Trade can make everyone better off
-  People gain from their ability to train with one another
-  Competition results in gains from trading
-  Trade allows people to specialize in what they do best

##### Principle #6 : Markets are usually a good way to organize Economic Activity
-  A *market economy* is an economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services
	-  Households decide what to buy and who to work for
	-  Firms decide who to hire and what to produce
-  Adam Smith made the observation that households and firms interacting in markets act as if guided by an "invisible hand"
	-  Because households and firms look at prices when deciding to buy and sell, they unknowingly take into account the social costs of their actions
	-  As a result, prices guide decision makers to reach outcomes that tend to maximize the welfare of society as a whole

##### Principle #7 : Governments can sometimes improve Market Outcomes
-  Markets work only if property rights are enforced.
	-  *Property rights* are the ability of an individual to own and exercise control over a scarce resource
-  *Market failure* occurs when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently
-  When the market fails (breaks down) government can intervene to promote efficiency and equity
-  *Market failure* may be caused by:
	-  an *externality*, which is the impact of one person or firm's actions on the well-being of a bystander
	-  *market power*, which is the ability of a single person or firm to unduly influence market prices

### Economic Models
-  Economists use models to simplify reality in order to improve our understanding of the world.
-  The two most basic economic models are:
	-  The Circular Flow Diagram
	-  The Production Possibilities Frontier

#### The Circular Low Diagram:
The *circular-flow diagram* is a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms.

![[Pasted image 20250613064616.png]]

-  Firms
	-  Produce and sell goods and services
	-  Hire and use factors of productions
-  Households
	-  Buy and consume goods and services
	-  Own and sell factors of production
-  Markets for Goods and Services
	-  Firms sell
	-  Households buy
-  Markets for Factors of Production
	-  Households sell
	-  Firms buy
-  Factors of Production
	-  Inputs used to produce goods and services
	-  Land, labor and capital

#### The Production Possibilities Frontier:
The *production possibilities frontier* is a graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology

![[Pasted image 20250613065451.png]]

-  Concepts illustrated by the production possibilities frontier
	-  Efficiency, Trade-offs, Opportunity cost, Economic growth

![[Pasted image 20250613065719.png]]

#### Positive versus Normative Analysis
-  *Positive statements* are statements that attempt to describe the world as it is.             Called descriptive analysis. It is an assertion about how the world is.
-  *Normative statements* are statements about how the world should be.                        Called prescriptive analysis. It is an assertion about how the world ought to be.


### The Market Forces of Supply and Demand:

*Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work. Modern microeconomics is about supply, demand and market equilibrium.*

A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people . . . as they interact with one another in markets.
Buyers determine *demand*.  Sellers determine *supply*.
A *competitive market* is a market in which there are many buyers and sellers so that each has a negligible impact on the market price.

Perfect Competition:
-  Products are the same
-  Numerous buyers and sellers so that each has no influence over price
-  Buyers and sellers are price takers

Monopoly: One seller, and controls selling control prices

Oligopoly:
-  Few sellers
-  Not always aggressive competition

Monopolistic Competition:
-  Many sellers
-  Slightly differentiated products
-  Each seller may set a price for its own product

## Demand:
-  *Quantity demanded* is the amount of good that buyers are willing and able to purchase.
-  **Law of Demand**
	-  The *law of demand* states that, other things equal, the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises.

#### The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity demanded.

-  **Demand Schedule**
	-  The *demand schedule* is a table that shows the relationship between the price of the good and the quantity demanded.
	-  The *demand curve* is a graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.
	
![[Pasted image 20250614083427.png]]

-  Market demand refers to the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.
-  Graphically, individual demand curves are summed horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.

![[Pasted image 20250614083622.png]]

-  **Change in Quantity Demanded**
	-  Movement along the demand curve
	-  Caused by a change in the price of the product.

![[Pasted image 20250614083811.png]]

-  **Shifts in the Demand Curve**
	-  Consumer income
	-  Prices of related goods
	-  Tastes
	-  Expectations
	-  Number of buyers
-  **Change in Demand**
	-  A shift in the demand curve, either to the left or right.
	-  Caused by any change that alters the quantity demanded at every price.

![[Pasted image 20250614084148.png]]

-  **Consumer Income**
	-  As income increases the demand for a *normal good* will increase.
	-  As income increases the demand for an *inferior good* will decrease.

![[Pasted image 20250614084335.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250614084359.png]]

-  **Prices of Related Goods**
	-  When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called *substitutes*.
	-  When a fall in the price of one good increases the demand for another good, the two goods are called *complements*.

![[Pasted image 20250614084644.png]]

## Supply
-  *Quantity supplied* is the amount of good that sellers are willing and able to sell.
-  **Law of Supply**
	-  The *law of supply* states that, other things equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises.

### The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Supplied

-  **Supply Schedule**
	-  The *supply schedule* is a table that shows the relationship between the price of the good and the quantity supplied.
-  **Supply Curve**
	-  The supply curve is the graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.

![[Pasted image 20250614085134.png]]

-  Market Supply refers to the sum of all individual supplies for all sellers of a particular good or service.
-  Graphically, individual supply curves are summed horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.
-  **Shifts in Supply Curve**
	-  Input prices
	-  Technology
	-  Expectations
	-  Number of sellers
-  **Change in Quantity Supplied**
	-  Movement along the supply curve
	-  Caused by a change in anything that alters the quantity supplied 

![[Pasted image 20250614091155.png]]

-  **Change in Supply**
	-  A shift in the supply curve, either to the left or right
	-  Caused by a change in a determinant other than price.

![[Pasted image 20250614091310.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614091343.png]]

## Supply and Demand Together:
-  *Equilibrium* refers to a situation in which the price has reached the level where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded
-  *Equilibrium Price*
	-  The price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded
	-  On a graph, it is the price at which the supply and demand curves intersect.
-  *Equilibrium Quantity*
	-  The quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price.
	-  On a graph it is the quantity at which the supply and demand curves intersect

![[Pasted image 20250614091723.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614091744.png]]

## Equilibrium:

-  ***Surplus***
	-  When price > equilibrium price, then quantity supplied > quantity demanded.
		-  There is excess supply or a surplus
		-  Suppliers will lower the price to increase sales, thereby moving toward equilibrium.
![[Pasted image 20250614092007.png]]

-  ***Shortage***
	-  When price < equilibrium price, then quantity demanded > the quantity supplied.
		-  There is excess demand or shortage
		-  Suppliers will raise the price due to too many buyers chasing too few goods, thereby moving toward equilibrium.

![[Pasted image 20250614092201.png]]

- ***Law of supply and demand***
	-  The claim that the price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded for that good into balance.

![[Pasted image 20250614092331.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614092405.png]]

- **Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves**
	-  A shift in the supply curve is called a change in supply.
	-  A movement along a fixed supply curve is called a change in demand.
	-  A shift in the demand curve is called a change in demand
	-  A movement along a fixed demand curve is called a change in quantity demanded.

![[Pasted image 20250614092637.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614092658.png]]


## The Elasticity of Supply:
*Price elasticity of supply* is a measure of how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good.
Price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied resulting from a percentage change in price.

![[Pasted image 20250617102823.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617102848.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617102919.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617102944.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617103025.png]]

***The Price Elasticity of Supply and its Determinants:***
-  Ability of sellers to change the amount of the good they produce.
	-  Beach-front land is inelastic.
	-  Books, cars, or manufactures goods are elastic.
-  Time Period
	-  Supply is more elastic in the long run.

***Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply***
-  The price elasticity of supply is computed as the percentage change in the quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.
![[Pasted image 20250617103436.png]]

***What happens to wheat farmers and the market for wheat when university agronomists discover a new wheat hybrid that is more productive than existing varieties ?***

![[Pasted image 20250617103708.png]] 
# The Demand is Inelastic

***Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High ?***
Supply and Demand can behave differently in the short run and the long run
-  In the short run, both supply and demand for oil are relatively inelastic.
-  But in the long run, both are elastic

#### Elasticity . . .
***. . . allows us to analyze supply and demand with greater precision.***
***. . . is a measure of how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in market conditions.***

## The Elasticity of Demand
-  The *price elasticity of demand* is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good.
-  When we talk about *elasticity*, that responsiveness is always measured in percentage terms.
-  Specifically, the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded due to a percentage change in the price.
-  The price elasticity of demand is computed as the percentage change in the price.
![[Pasted image 20250617104637.png]]

#### The Price Elasticity of Demand and its Determinants:
-  Availability of Close substitutes
-  Necessities versus Luxuries
-  Definition of the Market
-  Time Horizon

**Demand tends to be more elastic:**
-  the larger the number of close substitutes.
-  if the good is a luxury
-  the longer the time period

***The Midpoint Method:*** *A Better Way to Calculate Percentage Changes and Elasticities*
The midpoint formula is preferable when calculating the price elasticity of demand because it gives the same answer regardless of the direction of the price change.
![[Pasted image 20250617105222.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617105247.png]]

### The Variety of Demand Curves:
-  ***Inelastic Demand***
	-  Quantity demanded does not respond strongly to price changes
	-  Absolute Value of Price elasticity of demand is between 0 and 1.
-  ***Elastic Demand***
	-  Quantity demanded responds strongly to changes in price
	-  Absolute Value of Price elasticity of demand is greater than one.

![[Pasted image 20250617110216.png]]

#### The Variety of Demand Curves
-  ***Perfectly Inelastic*** : Quantity demanded does not respond to price changes
-  ***Perfectly Elastic*** : Quantity demanded changes infinitely with any change in price
-  ***Unit Elastic*** : Quantity demanded changes by the same percentage as the price

![[Pasted image 20250617110459.png]]

-  Because the price elasticity of demand measures how much quantity demanded responds to the price, it is closely related to the slope of the demand curve.
-  But it is not the same thing as the slope.

![[Pasted image 20250617110845.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617110909.png]]

***Why not just use the slope of a demand curve to measure the sensitivity of quantity demanded to a change in a commodity's own price ?***
*Because the value of sensitivity then depends upon the (arbitrary) units of measurement used for quantity demanded.*

### Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand:
***Total Revenue*** is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good.
Computed as the price of the good times the quantity sold.
#####        **TR = P X Q**

![[Pasted image 20250617111827.png]]

#### Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve
With an inelastic demand curve, an increase in price leads to a decrease in quantity that is proportionately smaller. Thus, total revenue increases.
**How Total Revenue Changes When Price Changes :**
**Inelastic Demand**
![[Pasted image 20250617112104.png]]

With an elastic demand curve, an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is proportionately larger. Thus, *total revenue decreases*.

## Other Demand Elasticities

#### Income Elasticity of Demand
-  *Income elasticity of demand* measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumer's income.
-  It is computed as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
**Computing Income Elasticity**
![[Pasted image 20250617112808.png]]
***Remember, all elasticities are measured by dividing one percentage change by another***
**Types of Goods**
-  Normal Goods: Income elasticity is positive
-  Inferior Goods: Income elasticity is negative
*Higher income raises the quantity demanded for normal goods, but lowers the quantity demanded for inferior goods*
-  Good consumers regard as necessities tend to be income inelastic
	-  Examples include food, fuel, clothing, utilities, and medical services
-  Good consumers regard as luxuries tend to be income elastic
	-  Examples include sports cars, furs, and expensive foods

#### Cross-price elasticity of demand
A measure of how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price if another good, computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded of the first good divided by the percentage change in the price of the second good
-  For complements, cross price elasticity is negative
-  For substitutes, cross price elasticity is positive
![[Pasted image 20250617113758.png]]

## Supply, Demand and Government Policies:
In a free, unregulated market system, market forces establish prices and exchange quantities.
While equilibrium conditions may be efficient, it may be true that not everyone is satisfied.
One of the roles of economists is to use their theories to assist in the development of policies.

***Controls on Prices:***
-  Are usually enacted when policy makers believe the market price is unfair to buyers or sellers.
-  Result in government-created price ceilings and floors.
-  *Price Ceiling*: A legal **maximum** on the price at which a good can be sold.
-  *Price Floor*: A legal **minimum** on the price at which a good can be sold.

**How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes:**
-  Two outcomes are possible when the government imposes a price ceiling:
	-  The price ceiling is not binding if set above the equilibrium price
	-  The price ceiling is binding if set below the equilibrium price, leading to a shortage.

![[Pasted image 20250618100718.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618100739.png]]

-  ***A binding price ceiling creates***
	-  Shortages because $Q_D$>$Q_S$
		-  Example: Gasoline shortage of the 1970s
	-  Nonprice rationing
		-  Examples: Long lines, discrimination by sellers

#### Case Study: Rent Control in the Short Run and Long Run
-  Rent controls are ceilings placed on the rents that landlords may charge their tenants.
-  The goal of rent control policy is to help the poor by making housing more affordable.
![[Pasted image 20250618101249.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618101302.png]]

**How Price Floors affect Market Outcomes:**
When the government imposes a price floor, two outcomes are possible:
-  The price floor is not binding if set below the equilibrium price.
-  The price floor is binding if set above the equilibrium price, leading to a surplus.

![[Pasted image 20250618103823.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618103840.png]]

-  A price floor prevents supply and demand from moving toward the equilibrium price and quantity.
-  When the market price hits the floor, it can fall no further, and the market price equals the floor price.

#### Case Study: The Minimum Wage
-  An important example of a price floor is the minimum wage.
-  Minimum wage laws dictate the lowest price possible for labor that any employer may pay.
![[Pasted image 20250618104149.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618104204.png]]

## Taxes:
***Governments levy taxes to raise revenue for public projects***

**How taxes on buyers (and sellers) affect Market outcomes:**
-  Taxes discourage market activity
-  When a good is taxed, the quantity sold is smaller
-  Buyers and sellers share the tax burden
-  **Elasticity and Tax incidence:**
	-  *Tax Incidence* is the manner in which the burden of a tax is shared among participants in a market.
	-  Tax incidence is the study of who bears the burden of a tax
	-  Taxes result in a change in market equilibrium
	-  Buyers pay more and sellers receive less, regardless of whom tax is levied on.
![[Pasted image 20250618104642.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618104700.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250618104810.png]]

***In what proportions is the burden of the tax divided ?***
***How do the effects of taxes on sellers compare to those levied on buyers ?***
*The answers to these questions depend on the elasticity of demand and the elasticity of supply.*

![[Pasted image 20250618105032.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618105043.png]]

***The burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic.***

## The Costs of Production

**What are Costs ?**
-  According to the **Law of Supply**:
	-  Firms are willing to produce and sell a greater quantity of a good when the price of the good is high
	-  This results in a supply curve that slopes upward.
-  The Firm's Objective:
	-  The economic goal of the firm is to **maximize profits**.

***Total Revenue***: The amount a firm receives for the sale of its output.
***Total Cost***: The market value of the inputs a firm uses in production.
***Profit*** is the firm's total revenue minus its total cost.
**Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost**

**Costs as Opportunity Costs:**
-  A firm's cost of production includes all the opportunity costs of making its output of goods and services.
-  Explicit and Implicit Costs
	-  A firm's cost of production include *explicit costs* and *implicit costs*:
		-  Explicit costs are input costs that require a direct outlay of money by the firm.
		-  Implicit costs are input costs that do not require an outlay of money by the firm.

**Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit:**
-  Economists measure a firm's *economic profit* as total revenue minus total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs.
-  Accountants measure the *accounting profit* as the firm's total revenue minus only the firm's explicit costs.
-  When total revenue exceeds both explicit and implicit costs, the firm earns economic profit.
-  Economic profit is smaller than accounting profit.
![[Pasted image 20250618110336.png]]

**Production and Costs:**
-  **The Production Function:**
	-  The *production function* shows the relationship between quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good.
-  **Marginal Product:**
	-  The *marginal product* of any input in the production process is the increase in output that arises from an additional unit of that input.

#### Production Function:
*Diminishing marginal product* is the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases.
-  Example: As more and more of workers are hired at a firm, each additional worker contributes less and less to production because the firm has a limited amount of equipment.
![[Pasted image 20250618110900.png]]

#### Diminishing Marginal Product:
-  The slope of production function measures the marginal product of an input, such as a worker.
-  When the marginal product declines, the production function becomes flatter.

**From the Production Function to the Total-Cost Curve:**
-  The relationship between the quantity a firm can produce and its costs determine pricing decisions
-  The total-cost curve shows this relationship graphically.
![[Pasted image 20250618111155.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618111209.png]]

#### The Various Measure of Cost:
Costs of production may be divided into *fixed costs* and *variable costs*.
-  **Fixed costs** are those costs that *do not vary* with the quantity of output produced.
-  **Variable costs** are those costs that *do vary* with the quantity of output produced.
**Total Costs:**
-  Total Fixed Costs (TFC)
-  Total Variable Costs (TVC)
-  Total Costs (TC)
-  TC = TFC + TVC
![[Pasted image 20250618111559.png]]

**Average Costs:**
-  Average costs can be determined by dividing the firm's costs by the quantity of output it produces.
-  The average cost is the cost of each typical unit of product.
-  Average Costs:
	-  Average Fixed Costs (AFC)
	-  Average Variable Costs (AVC)
	-  Average Total Costs (ATC)
	-  ATC = AFC + AVC
-  AFC = (Fixed Cost)/(Quantity) = FC/Q
-  AVC = (Variable Cost)/(Quantity) = VC/Q
-  ATC = (Total Cost)/(Quantity) = TC/Q

**Marginal Cost**
-  *Marginal Cost* (MC) measures the increase in total cost that arises from an extra unit of production.
-  Marginal Cost helps answer the following question:
	-  *How much does it cost to produce an additional unit of output ?*
-  MC = (change in total cost)/(change in quantity) = ($\Delta$TC)/($\Delta$Q)
![[Pasted image 20250618112248.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618112300.png]]

-  Marginal cost rises with the amount of output produced
	-  This reflects the property of diminishing marginal product.
-  Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost
	-  Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling.
	-  Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is rising.
	-  The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the efficient scale.
		-  *Efficient scale* is the quantity that minimizes average total cost.
![[Pasted image 20250618112636.png]]

-  Three Important Properties of Cost Curves:
	-  Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output.
	-  The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of average total cost.

**Cost Curves and Their Shapes:**
-  The average total-cost curve is U-shaped.
-  At very low levels of output average total cost is high because fixed cost is spread over only a few units.
-  Average total cost declines as output increases.
-  Average total cost starts rising because average variable cost rises substantially.
-  The bottom of the U-shaped ATC curve occurs at the quantity that minimizes average total cost. This quantity is sometimes called the ***efficient scale of the firm.***

**Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run:**
-  For many firms, the division of total costs between fixed and variable costs depends on the time horizon being considered.
	-  In the short run, some costs are fixed.
	-  In the long run, all *fixed costs* become variable costs.
-  Because many costs are fixed in the short run but variable in the long run, a firm's long-run cost curves differ from its short-run cost curves.

## Economies and Diseconomies of Scale:
-  *Economies of scale* refer to the property whereby long-run average total cost falls as the quantity of output increases.
-  *Diseconomies of scale* refer to the property whereby long-run average total cost rises as the quantity of output increases.
-  *Constant returns to scale* refers to the property whereby long-run average total cost stays the same as the quantity of output increases.
![[Pasted image 20250619100438.png]]

***What is a Competitive Market ?***
A *competitive market* has many buyers and sellers trading identical products so that each buyer and seller is a price taker.
-  Buyers and sellers must accept the price determined by the market.
-  A *perfectly competitive market* has the following characteristics:
	-  There are many buyers and sellers in the market.
	-  The goods offered by the various sellers are largely the same.
	-  Firms can freely enter or exit the market.
-  As a result of its characteristics, the perfectly competitive market has the following outcomes:
	-  The actions of any single buyer or seller in the market have a negligible impact on the market price.
	-  Each buyer and seller takes the market price as given.

**The Revenue of a Competitive Firm:**
-  Total Revenue for a firm is the selling price times the quantity sold.
-  **TR = (P X Q)**
-  Total Revenue is proportional to the amount of output.
-  *Average Revenue* tells us how much revenue a firm receives for the typical unit sold.
-  Average revenue is total revenue divided by the quantity sold.
-  In perfect competition, average revenue equals the price of the good.
-  *Marginal revenue* is the change in total revenue from an additional unit sold.
-  **MR = ($\Delta$TR)/($\Delta$Q)**
-  For competitive firms, marginal revenue equals the price of the good.
![[Pasted image 20250619102812.png]]

**Profit Maximization and the Competitive Firm's Supply Curve:**
-  The goal of a competitive firm is to maximize profit.
-  This means that the firm will want to produce the quantity that maximizes the *difference between total revenue and total cost.*
![[Pasted image 20250619104150.png]]

**The Marginal Cost-Curve and the Firm's Supply Decision:**
Profit maximization occurs at the quantity where *marginal revenue equals marginal cost.*
-  When MR > MC, increase Q
-  When MR < MC, decrease Q
-  When MR = MC, profit is maximized.
-  Under perfect competition, P = MR = AR
![[Pasted image 20250619104439.png]]

**The Firm's Short-Run Decision to Shut Down**
-  A shutdown refers to a short-run decision not to produce anything during a specific period of time because of current market conditions.
-  Exit refers to a long-run decision to leave the market.
-  The firm shuts down if the revenue it gets from producing is less than the variable cost of production.
	-  Shut down if TR < VC
	-  Shut down if TR/Q < VC/Q
	-  Shut down if P < AVC
![[Pasted image 20250619104739.png]]

-  The portion of the marginal-cost curve that lies above average variable cost is the competitive firm's short-run supply curve.

**The Firm's Long-Run Decision to Exit or Enter a Market:**
-  In the long run, the firm exits if the revenue it would get from producing is less than its total cost.
	-  Exit if TR < TC
	-  Exit if TR/Q < TC/Q
	-  Exit if P < ATC
-  A firm will enter the industry if such an action would be profitable:
	-  Enter if TR > TC
	-  Enter if TR/Q > TC/Q
	-  Enter if P > ATC
![[Pasted image 20250619105226.png]]

**Measuring Profit in Our Graph for the Competitive Firm**
-  Profit = TR - TC
-  Profit = (TR/Q - TC/Q) X Q
-  Profit = (P - ATC) X Q
![[Pasted image 20250619105355.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250619105409.png]]

## The Supply Curve in a Competitive Market:
The competitive firm's *long-run supply curve* is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that lies above average total cost.
-  **Short-Run Supply Curve**: The portion of its marginal cost curve that lies above average variable cost.
-  **Long-Run Supply Curve**: The marginal cost curve above the minimum point of its average total cost curve.
Market supply equals the sum of the quantities supplied by the individual firms in the market.

**The Short Run: Market Supply with a Fixed Number of Firms**
-  For any given price, each firm supplies a quantity of output so that its marginal cost equals price.
-  The market supply curve reflects the individual firm's marginal cost curves.
![[Pasted image 20250619105858.png]]

**The Long Run: Market Supply with Entry and Exit**
-  Firms will enter or exit the market until profit is driven to zero.
-  In the long run, price equals the minimum of average total cost.
-  The long-run market supply curve is horizontal at this price.
![[Pasted image 20250619110122.png]]

-  At the end of the process of entry and exit, firms that remain must be making zero economic profit.
-  The process of entry and exit ends only when price and average total cost are driven to equality.
-  Long-run equilibrium must have firms operating at their efficient scale

**Why Do Competitive Firms Stay in Business If they make Zero Profit ?**
-  Profit equals total revenue minus total cost.
-  Total cost includes all the opportunity costs of the firm.
-  In the zero-profit equilibrium, the firm's revenue compensates the owners for the time and money they expend to keep the business going.

**A Shift in Demand in the Short Run and Long Run**
-  An increase in demand raises price and quantity in the short run.
-  Firms earn profits because price now exceeds average total cost.

![[Pasted image 20250619110833.png]]

## Monopoly:
While a competitive *price taker*, a monopoly firm is a *price maker*.
A firm is considered a *monopoly* if . . .
-  it is the sole seller of its product
-  its product does not have close substitutes

**Why Monopolies Arise ?**
The fundamental cause of monopoly is *barriers to entry*.
Barriers to entry have three sources:
-  Ownership of a key resource
-  The government gives a single firm the exclusive right to produce some good
-  Costs of production make a single producer more efficient than a large number of producers.
Although exclusive ownership of a key resource is a potential source of monopoly, in practice monopolies rarely arise for this reason.

**Government - Created Monopolies:**
Governments may restrict entry by giving a single firm the exclusive right to sell a particular good in certain markets.
Patent and copyright laws are two important examples of how government creates a monopoly to serve the public interest.

**Natural Monopolies:**
An industry is a *natural monopoly* when a single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market at a smaller cost than could two or more firms.
A natural monopoly arises when there are economies of scale over the relevant range of output.

![[Pasted image 20250619111745.png]]

## How Monopolies make Production and Pricing Decisions:

**Monopoly versus Competition**
-  Monopoly 
	-  Is the sole producer
	-  Faces a downward-sloping demand curve
	-  Is a price maker
	-  Reduces price to increase sales
-  Competitive Firm
	-  Is one of many producers
	-  Faces a horizontal demand curve
	-  Is a price taker
	-  Sells as much or as little at same price
![[Pasted image 20250619112039.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250619112107.png]]

#### A Monopoly's Revenue:
**A Monopoly's Marginal Revenue:**
-  A monopolist's marginal revenue is always less than the price of its good
	-  The demand curve is downward sloping
	-  When a monopoly drops the price to sell one more unit, the revenue received from previously sold units also decreases.
	-  When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, it has two effects on total revenue (P X Q)
		-  The output effect - more output is sold, so Q is higher
		-  The price effect - price falls, so P is lower.
![[Pasted image 20250619112508.png]]

**Profit Maximization:**
-  A monopoly maximizes profit by producing the quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost
-  It then uses the demand curve to find the price that will induce consumers to buy that quantity.
![[Pasted image 20250619112652.png]]

-  Comparing Monopoly and Competition:
	-  For a competitive firm, price equals marginal cost. **P = MR = MC**
	-  For a monopoly firm, price exceeds marginal cost. **P > MR = MC**
	-  Remember, all profit-maximizing firms set MR = MC.
![[Pasted image 20250619112919.png]]

-  The monopolist will receive economic profits as long as price is greater than average total cost.
![[Pasted image 20250619113022.png]]

## Price Discrimination:
*Price Discrimination* is the business practice of selling the same good at different prices to different customers, even though the costs for producing for the two customers are the same.

-  Price discrimination is not possible when good is sold in a competitive market since there are many firms all selling at the market price. In order to price discriminate, the firm must have some *market power*.
-  Perfect Price Discrimination:
	-  Perfect price discrimination refers to the situation when the monopolist knows exactly the willingness to pay of each customer and can charge each customer a different price.

**The Analytics of Price Discrimination:**
Two important effects of price discrimination:
-  It can increase monopolist's profits.
-  Example: Movie tickets, Airline prices, Discount coupons, Financial aid, Quantity discounts.

#### The Prevalence of Monopoly:
How prevalent are the problems of monopolies ?
-  Monopolies are common
-  Most firms have some control over their prices because of differentiated products
-  Firms with substantial monopoly power are rare.
-  Few goods are truly unique.
![[Pasted image 20250619113806.png]]

## Consumers, Producers and the Efficiency of Markets:

**Revisiting the Market Equilibrium:**
-  Do the equilibrium price and quantity maximize the total welfare of buyers and sellers ?
-  Market equilibrium reflects the way markets allocate scarce resources
-  Whether the market allocation is desirable can be addressed by welfare economics

**Welfare Economics:**
-  *Welfare Economics* is the study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being
-  Buyers and sellers receive benefits from taking part in the market
-  In the following slides, by 'equilibrium' we mean the one in a perfectly competitive market
-  The equilibrium in a market maximizes the total welfare of buyers and sellers.
-  ***Equilibrium in the market results in maximum benefits, and therefore maximum total welfare for both the consumers and the producers of the product.***
-  Consumer surplus measures economic welfare from the buyer's side.
-  Producer surplus measures economic welfare from the seller's side.
-  *Willingness to pay* is the maximum amount that a buyer will pay for a good.
-  It measures how much the buyer values the good or service.
-  *Consumer surplus* is the buyer's willingness to pay for a good minus the amount the buyer actually pays for it
![[Pasted image 20250620095700.png]]

-  The market demand curve depicts the various quantities that buyers would be willing and able to purchase at different prices
![[Pasted image 20250620095809.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620095825.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620095912.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620095924.png]]

-  The area below the demand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in the market.
![[Pasted image 20250620100010.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620100107.png]]

-  Consumer surplus, the amount that buyers are willing to pay for a good minus the amount they actually pay for it, measures the benefit that buyers receive from a good as the buyers themselves perceive it.

-  *Producer surplus* is the amount a seller is paid for a good minus the seller's *cost*.
-  It measures the benefit to sellers participating in a market
![[Pasted image 20250620100542.png]]

-  Just as consumer surplus is related to the demand curve, producer surplus is closely related to the supply curve.
![[Pasted image 20250620100701.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620100717.png]]

-  The area below the price and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market.
![[Pasted image 20250620100809.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620100824.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620100930.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620131628.png]]

## Market Efficiency:
Consumer surplus and producer surplus may be used to address the following question:
-  Is the allocation of resources determined by free markets in any way desirable ?

**Consumer Surplus = Value to buyers - Amount paid by buyers**
**Producer Surplus = Amount received by sellers - Cost to sellers**
**Total Surplus = Consumer surplus + Producer surplus = Value to buyers - Cost to                                  sellers**

-  *Efficiency* is the property of a resource allocation of maximizing the total surplus received by all members of society
-  In addition to market efficiency, a social planner might also care about *equity* - the fairness of the distribution of well-being among the various buyers and sellers.
![[Pasted image 20250620132317.png]]

#### Three Insights Concerning Market Outcomes:
-  By "Free Markets" we mean Perfect Competition, where there is free entry and exit of firms in long run.
-  Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them most highly, as measured by their willingness to pay.
-  Free markets allocate the demand for goods to sellers who can produce them at least cost.
-  Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
![[Pasted image 20250620135640.png]]

### Evaluating the Market Equilibrium:
-  Because the equilibrium outcome is an efficient allocation of resources, the social planner can leave the market outcome as he/she finds it.
-  This policy of leaving well enough alone goes by the French expression *laissez faire.* 
**Market Power:**
If a market system is not perfectly competitive, market power may result 
-  Market power is the ability to influence prices.
-  Market power can cause markets to be efficient because it keeps price and quantity from the equilibrium of supply and demand.
![[Pasted image 20250620140040.png]]

**Externalities:**
-  created when a market outcome affects individuals other than buyers and sellers in that market.
-  cause welfare in market to depend on more than just the value to buyers and cost to the sellers.
When buyers and sellers do not take externalities into account when deciding how much to consume and produce, the equilibrium in the market can be inefficient.

## The Theory of Market Choice:
The theory of consumer choice addresses the following questions:
-  Do all demand curves slope downward ?
-  How do wages affect labor supply ?
-  How do interest rates affect household saving ?

### The Budget Constraint: What the Consumer can Afford
The *budget constraint* depicts the limit on the consumption "bundles" that a consumer can afford
-  People consume less than they desire because their spending is constrained, or limited by their income.
-  The budget constraint shows the various combinations of goods the consumer can afford given his/her income and the prices of the two goods.
-  Suppose there are two goods, Pizza (x) and Pepsi (y). 
-  Let Income of consumer is 1000 dollars, price of pizza is 10 dollars per unit and Pepsi is 2 dollars per unit.
-  The Budget Constraint in this case is given by : **10x + 2y = 1000**
![[Pasted image 20250620140920.png]]

### The Consumer's Budget Constraint:
- Any point on the budget constraint line indicates the consumer's combination or trade-off between two goods.
-  For example, if the consumer buys no pizzas, he can afford 500 pints of Pepsi (point B). If he buys no Pepsi, he can afford 100 pizzas (point A).
![[Pasted image 20250620141132.png]]

-  Alternatively, the consumer can buy 50 pizzas and 250 pints of Pepsi.
![[Pasted image 20250620141219.png]]

-  The *slope* of the budget constraint line equals the relative price of the two goods, that is, *the price of one good compared to the price of the other*
-  It measures the rate at which the consumer can trade one good for the other
-  A consumer's preference among consumption bundles may be illustrated with indifference curves.
-  An *indifference curve* is a curve that shows consumption bundles that give the consumer the same level of satisfaction.
![[Pasted image 20250620141648.png]]

## Representing Preferences with Indifference Curves
#### The Consumer's Preferences:
The consumer is indifferent, or equally happy with the combinations shown at points A, B, and C because they are all on the same curve.

#### The Marginal Rate of Substitution:
The slope at any point on an indifference curve is the *marginal rate of substitution*.
-  It is the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another.
-  It is the amount of one good that a consumer requires as compensation to give up one unit of the other good.
![[Pasted image 20250620142131.png]]

## Four Properties of Indifference Curves:

-  **Higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones**
-  **Indifference curves are downward sloping**
-  **Indifference curves do not cross**
-  **Indifference curves are bowed inward**

#### Property 1: Higher Indifference curves are preferred to lower ones
-  Consumers usually prefer more of something to less of it
-  Higher indifference curves represent larger quantities of goods than do lower indifference curves.
![[Pasted image 20250620142524.png]]

#### Property 2: Indifference Curves are downward sloping
-  A consumer is willing to give up one good only if he or she gets more of the other good in order to remain equally happy
-  If the quantity of one good is reduced, the quantity of the other good must increase.
-  For this reason, most indifference curves slope downward
-  Remember, a consumer is equally happy at all points along a given indifference curve.
![[Pasted image 20250620142828.png]]

#### Property 3: Indifference Curves do not cross
-  Points A and B should make the consumer equally happy.
-  Points B and C should make the consumer equally happy.
-  This implies that A and C should make the consumer equally happy.
-  But C has more of both goods compared to A.
![[Pasted image 20250620143042.png]]

#### Property 4: Indifference curves are bowed inward
-  People are more willing to trade away goods that they have in abundance and less willing to trade away goods of which they have little.
-  These differences in a consumer's marginal substitution rates cause his or her indifference curve to bow inward.
![[Pasted image 20250620143319.png]]

### Two Extreme Examples of Indifference Curves:
**Perfect Substitutes:**
-  Two goods with straight line indifference curves are *perfect substitutes*.
-  The marginal rate of substitution is a fixed number.
![[Pasted image 20250620143523.png]]

**Perfect Complements:**
-  Two goods with right-angle indifference curves are *perfect complements*.
-  Since these goods are always used together, extra units of one good, outside the desired consumption ratio, add no additional satisfaction.
![[Pasted image 20250620143712.png]]

#### Optimization: What the Consumer Chooses
-  Consumers want to get the combination of goods on the highest possible indifference curve. 
-  However, the consumer must also end up on or below his budget constraint.

#### The Consumer's Optimal Choices:
-  Combing the indifference curve and the budget constraint determines the consumer's optimal choice.
-  Consider a well-behaved indifference curve that is bowed inward.
-  Consumer optimum occurs at the point where the highest indifference curve and the budget constraint are tangent.
-  The consumer chooses consumption of the two goods so that the marginal rate of substitution equals the relative price.
-  At the consumer's optimum, the consumer's valuation of the two goods equals the market's valuation.
![[Pasted image 20250620144339.png]]

-  An increase in income shifts the budget constraint outward.
	-  The consumer is able to choose a better combination of goods on a higher indifference curve.
![[Pasted image 20250620144455.png]]

-  Normal vs. Inferior Goods:
	-  If a consumer buys more of a good when his or her income rises, the good is called a *normal good*.
	-  If a consumer buys less of a good when his or her income rises, the good is called an *inferior good*.
![[Pasted image 20250620144631.png]]

-  A fall in the price of any good rotates the budget constraint outward and changes the slope of the budget constraint.
![[Pasted image 20250620144731.png]]

-  A price change has two effects on consumption:
	-  An income effect
	-  A substitution effect
-  **The Substitution Effect:**
	-  The *substitution effect* is the change in consumption that results when a price change moves the consumer along an indifference curve to a point with a different marginal rate of substitution.
-  **The Income Effect:**
	-  The *income effect* is the change in consumption that results when a price change moves the consumer to a higher or lower indifference curve.

## The Theory of Consumer Choice:
### How Changes in Income Affect the Consumer's Choices:

An increase in income shifts the budget constraint outward.
-  The consumer is able to choose a better combination of goods on a higher indifference curve.
![[Pasted image 20250620145306.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620145333.png]]

-  A fall in the price of any good rotates the budget constraint outward and changes the slope of the budget constraint.
![[Pasted image 20250620145434.png]]

**Income and Substitution Effects**
-  A Change in Price: Substitution Effect
	-  A price change first causes the consumer to move from one point on an indifference curve to another on the same curve.
	-  Illustrated by movement from point A to B
-  A Change in Price: Income Effect
	-  After moving from one point to another on the same curve, the consumer will move to another indifference curve.
	-  Illustrated by movement from point B to C
![[Pasted image 20250620145824.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250620145841.png]]

-  A Consumer's demand curve can be viewed as a summary of the optimal decisions that arise from his or her budget constraint and indifference curves.
![[Pasted image 20250620145958.png]]

***Do all demand curves slope downward ?***
-  *Demand curves can sometimes slope upward*
-  *This happens when a consumer buys more of a good when its price rises*
-  *Suppose there is a commodity x and its price is P*
-  *When P falls, x becomes relatively cheaper in relation to other good y.*

Substitution effect entails the consumer will consume more of x even though he is confined to the same indifference curve of the pre price change level. This holds for both normal and inferior goods.

For normal goods, income effect will entail an increase in consumption of x.
For inferior goods, income effect will entail a decrease in consumption of x.

For normal goods, both SE and IE work in the same direction and consumption of x is increased.
As a result, the demand curve for normal goods is always downward sloping

For inferior goods, SE and IE work in opposite directions. According to SE, x is raised. But according to IE, x is decreased.
If SE dominates IE, then for such inferior goods, the demand curve is till downward sloping.
If IE dominates SE, then for such inferior goods, the demand curve is upward sloping.

*Giffen goods:*
-  Economists use the term Giffen good to describe an inferior good that violates the law of demand, where the demand curve is upward sloping.
-  Giffen goods are goods for which an increase in the price raises the quantity demanded.

# Macro Economics:
The study of economy as a whole. We begin our study of macroeconomics with the country's total income and expenditure.

## Measuring a Nation's Income:
***In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:***
-  *What is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) ? *
-  *How is GDP related to a nation's total income and spending ?*
-  *What are the components of GDP ?*
-  *How is GDP corrected for inflation ?*
-  *Does GDP measure society's well-being ?*

#### Income and Expenditure:
***Gross Domestic Product (GDP)*** measures total income of everyone in the economy. GDP also measures total expenditure on the economy's output of g&s.
*For the economy as a whole, **income equals expenditure**, because every dollar of expenditure by a buyer is a dollar of income for the seller.*

#### The Circular-Flow Diagram:
-  is a simple depiction of the macroeconomy.
-  illustrates GDP as: spending, revenue, factor payments, and income.
-  First some preliminaries:
	-  **Factors of production** are inputs like labor, land, capital, and natural resources.
	-  **Factor payments** are payments to the factors of production (e.g., wages, rent)
-  **Households:**
	-  own the factors of production, sell/rent them to firms for income.
	-  buy and consume g&s.
-  **Firms**:
	-  buy/hire factors of production, use them to produce g&s.
	-  sell g&s.
![[Pasted image 20250621101755.png]]

**What this diagram omits:**
-  The government
	-  collects taxes
	-  purchases g&s
-  The financial system
	-  matches saver's supply of funds with borrower's demand for loans
-  The foreign sector
	-  trades g&s, financial assets, and currencies with country's residents

**GDP is . . .**
. . . the market value of all final goods & services produced within a country in a given period of time.

***Goods are valued at their market prices, so:***
-  ***GDP measures all goods using the same units (e.g., dollars in the U.S), rather than "adding apples to oranges".***
-  ***Things that don't have a market value are excluded, e.g., housework you do for yourself.***

***Final goods** are intended for the end user.*
***Intermediate goods** are used as components or ingredients in the production of other goods. GDP only includes final goods, as they already embody the value of the intermediate goods used in their production.*
*GDP includes tangible goods (like DVDs, mountain bikes, beer) and intangible services (dry cleaning, cell phone service)*
*GDP includes currently produced goods, not goods produced in the past.*
*GDP measures the value of production that occurs within a country's borders, whether done by its own citizens or by foreigners located there.*
*usually a year or a quarter (3 months).*

#### The Components of GDP:
-  Recall: GDP is total spending
-  Four components:
	-  Consumption (C)
	-  Investment (I)
	-  Government Purchases (G)
	-  Net Exports (NX)
-  These components add up to GDP (denoted Y):  **Y = C + I + G + NX**

**Consumption (C)**:
-  is total spending by households in g&s.
-  Note on housing costs:
	-  For renters, consumption includes rent payments
	-  For homeowners, consumption includes the imputed rental value of the house, but not the purchase price or mortgage payments.

**Investments (I):**
-  is total spending on goods that will be used in the future to produce more goods.
-  includes spending on:
	-  capital equipment (e.g., machines, tools)
	-  structures (factories, office buildings, houses)
	-  inventories (goods produced but not yet sold)
-  Note: **"Investment"** does not mean the purchase of financial assets like stocks and                bonds.

**Government Purchases (G):**
-  is all spending on the g&s purchased by govt at the federal, state and local levels.
-  G excludes **transfer payments**, such as Social Security or unemployment insurance benefits. These payments represent transfers of income, not purchase of g&s.

**Net Exports (NX):**
-  NX = exports - imports
-  Exports represent foreign spending on the economy's g&s.
-  Imports are the portions of C, I, and G that are spent on g&s produced abroad.
-  Adding up all the components of GDP gives: **Y = C + I + G + NX**
![[Pasted image 20250621105622.png]]

### Exercise Problem:
***In each of the following cases, determine how much GDP and each of its components is affected (if at all).
A.  Debbie spends $200 to buy her husband dinner at the finest restaurant in Boston.
B.  Sarah spends $1800 on a new laptop to use in her publishing business. The laptop was built in China.
C.  Jane spends $1200 on a computer to use in her editing business. She got last year's model on sale for a great price from a local manufacturer.
D.  General Motors builds $500 million worth of cars, but consumers only buy $470 million worth of them.***

*Answers:
A.  Consumption and GDP rise by $200
B.  Investment rises by $1800, net exports fall by $1800, GDP is unchanged
C.  Current GDP and investment don't change, because the computer was built last year.
D.  Consumption rises by $470 million, inventory investment rises by $30 million, and GDP rises by $500 million.*

#### Real vs. Nominal GDP:
-  Inflation can distort economic variables like GDP, so we have 2 versions of GDP: One is corrected for inflation, the other is not.
-  **Nominal GDP** values output using current prices. It is not corrected for inflation.
-  **Real GDP** values output using the prices of a ***base year***. Real GDP is corrected for inflation.

#### The GDP Deflator:
-  The GDP deflator is a measure of the overall level of prices.
-  Definition:
**GDP deflator = 100 X (nominal GDP)/(real GDP)**
-  One way to measure the economy's **inflation rate** is to compute the percentage increase in the GDP deflator from one year to the next.

### GDP and Economic Well-Being:
-  ***Real GDP per capita is the main indicator of the average person's standard of living.***
-  But GDP is not a perfect measure of well-being.
-  Robert Kennedy issued a very eloquent yet harsh criticism of GDP:

**Gross Domestic Product . . .**
*". . . does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our courage, nor our wisdom, nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile, and it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans."*

**GDP does not value:**
-  the quality of the environment
-  leisure time
-  non-market activity, such as the child care a parent provides his or her child at home
-  an equitable distribution of income

**Then why do we care about GDP ?**
-  Having a large GDP enables a country to afford better schools, a cleaner environment, health care, etc.
-  Many indicators of the quality of life are positively correlated with GDP. For example . . .

## Measuring the Cost of Living:

**In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:**
-  What is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ?
-  What are the problems with CPI ? How serious are they ?
-  How does the CPI differ from the GDP deflator ?
-  How can we use the CPI to compare dollar amounts from different years ? Why would we want to do this, anyway ?
-  How can we correct interest rates for inflation ?

### The Consumer Price Index (CPI):
-  Measures the typical consumer's cost of living.
-  The basis of cost of living adjustments (COLAs) in many contracts and in Social Security
**How the CPI is Calculated:**
-  ***Fix the "basket"***
*The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) surveys consumers to determine what's in the typical consumer's "shopping basket"*
-  ***Find the prices***
*The BLS collects data in the prices of all the goods in the basket.*
-  ***Compute the basket's cost***
*Use the prices to compute the total cost of the basket*
-  ***Choose a base year and compute the index***
The CPI in any year equals  **100 X (cost of basket in current year) / (cost of basket in base year)**
-  ***Compute the inflation rate***
The percentage change in the CPI from the preceding period.
*inflation rate = **(CPI this year - CPI last year)/(CPI last year) X 100%.***
![[Pasted image 20250622094540.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250622094554.png]]
#### Answers:
A.  ($10X20) + ($50X10) = $700
B.  cost of basket in 2005 = ($10X20) + ($60X10) = $800 
	CPI in 2005 = 100 X ($800/$700) = 114.3
C.  cost of basket in 2006 = ($12X20) + ($60X10) = $840
	CPI in 2006 = 100X($840/$700) = 120
	Inflation rate = (120 - 114.3)/114.3 = 5%

![[Pasted image 20250622095127.png]]

### Problems with CPI:
***Substitution Bias:***
-  Over time, some prices rise faster than others
-  Consumers substitute toward goods that become relatively cheaper
-  The CPI misses this substitution because it uses a fixed basket of goods
-  Thus, the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living.
***Introduction of New Goods***
-  When new goods become available, variety increases, allowing consumers to find products that more closely meet their needs.
-  This has the effect of making each dollar more valuable
-  The CPI misses this effect because it uses a fixed basket of goods
-  Thus, the CPI overstates increase in the cost of living.
***Unmeasured Quality Change***
-  Improvements in the quality of goods in the basket increase the value of each dollar
-  The BLS tries to account for quality changes, but probably misses some quality improvements, as quality is hard to measure
-  Thus, the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living.

Each of these problems causes the CPI to overstate cost of living increases. The BLS has made technical adjustments, but the CPI probably still overstates inflation by about 0.5 percent per year.
This is important, because Social Security payments and many contracts have COLAs tied to the CPI.

![[Pasted image 20250622100103.png]]

#### Correcting Variables for Inflation:
**Comparing Dollar Figures from Different Times**
-  Inflation makes it hard to compare dollar amounts from different times
-  We can use the CPI to adjust figures so that they can be compared
**Example: The High Price of Gasoline**
-  Price of a gallon of regular unleaded gas:
	-  $1.42 in March 1981
	-  $2.5 in August 2005
-  To compare these figures, we will use the CPI to express the 1981 gas price in "2005 dollars", what gas in 1981 would have cost if the cost of living were the same then as in 2005.
-  Multiply the 1981 gas price by the ratio of the CPI in 2005 to the CPI in 1981.
![[Pasted image 20250622100630.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250622100639.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250622100648.png]]

**Indexation:**
A dollar amount is indexed for inflation if it is automatically corrected for inflation by law or in a contract
For Example. the increase in the CPI automatically determines:
-  the COLA in many multi-year labor contracts
-  the adjustments in Social Security payments and federal income tax brackets

**Real vs. Nominal Interest Rates:**
The nominal interest rate:
-  the interest rate not corrected for inflation
-  the rate of growth in the dollar value of a deposit or debt
The real interest rate:
-  corrected for inflation
-  the rate of growth in the purchasing power of a deposit or debt
**Real interest rate = (nominal interest rate) - (inflation rate)**
Example:
-  Deposit $1,000 for one year
-  Nominal interest rate is 9%
-  During that year, inflation is 3.5%
-  Real interest rate = Nominal interest rate - Inflation = 9 - 3.5 = 5.5%
-  The purchasing power of the $1,000 deposit has grown 5.5%
![[Pasted image 20250622103127.png]]

## Production and Growth:
**In this chapter, we look for the answers to these questions:**
-  What are the facts about living standards and growth rates around the world ?
-  Why does productivity matter for living standards ?
-  What determines productivity and its growth rate ?
-  How can public policy affect growth and living standards ?
![[Pasted image 20250623110741.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250623110751.png]]

#### Incomes and Growth Around the World
Since growth rates vary, the country rankings can change over time:
-  Poor countries are not necessarily doomed to poverty forever - e.g., Singapore, incomes were low in 1960 and are quite high now.
-  Rich countries can't take their status for granted: They may be overtaken by poorer but faster-growing countries.

***Questions:***
-  ***Why are some countries richer than others ?***
-  ***Why do some countries grow quickly while others seem stuck in a poverty trap ?***
-  ***What policies may help raise growth rates and long-run living standards ?***

#### Productivity:
-  Recall one of the Ten Principles from Chapter 1: ***A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce g&s.***
-  This ability depends on **productivity**: the average quantity of g&s produced per unit of labor input.
-  **Y** = real GDP = quantity of output produced
	**L**  = quantity of labor 
	so we can write productivity as **Y/L** (output per worker).

#### Why Productivity is so Important ?
-  When a nation's workers are very productive, real GDP is large and incomes are high
-  When productivity grows rapidly, so do living standards.
-  What, then, determines productivity and its growth rate ?

#### Physical Capital per Worker
-  Recall: The stock of equipment and structures used to produce g&s is called **\[physical] capital**, denoted by **K**.
-  **K/L** = capital per worker
-  Productivity is higher when the average worker has more capital (machines, equipment, etc.)
-  i.e., an increase in **K/L** causes an increase in **Y/L**.

#### Human Capital per Worker
-  **Human capital (H)**: the knowledge and skills workers acquire through education, training, and experience.
-  **H/L** = the average worker's human capital
-  Productivity is higher when the average worker has more human capital (education, skills, etc.)
-  i.e., an increase in **H/L** causes an increase in **Y/L**.

#### Natural Resources per Worker
-  **Natural Resources (N)**: the inputs into production that nature provides, e.g., land, mineral deposits
-  Other things equal, more **N** allows a country to produce more **Y**. In per-worker terms, an increase in **N/L** causes an increase in **Y/L**.
-  Some countries are rich because they have abundant natural resources (e.g., Saudi Arabia has lots of oil)
-  But countries need not have much **N** to be rich (e.g., Japan imports the **N** it needs.)

#### Technological Knowledge
-  **Technological Knowledge**: society's understanding of the best ways to produce g&s
-  Technological progress does not only mean a faster computer, a higher-definition TV, or a smaller cell phone
-  It means any advance in knowledge that boosts productivity (allows society to get more output from its resources)
-  e.g., Henry Ford and the assembly line

#### Technological Knowledge vs. Human Capital
-  Technological knowledge refers to society's understanding of how to produce g&s.
-  Human capital results from the effort people expend to acquire this knowledge.
-  Both are important for productivity.

#### The Production Function:
-  The production function is a graph or equation showing the relation between output and inputs:
	**Y = A F(L, K, H, N)**
	**F()** - a function that shows how inputs are combined to produce output
	**"A"** - the level of technology 
-  **"A"** multiplies the function **F()**, so improvements in technology (increase in **"A"**) allow more output (**Y**) to be produced from any given combination of inputs.
-  The production function has the property **constant returns to scale**: Changing all inputs by the same percentage causes output to change by that percentage.
-  For example, doubling all inputs causes output to double, or increasing all inputs 10% causes output to increase by 10%
-  If we multiply each input by **1/L**, then output is multiplied by **1/L**:
	**Y/L** = **A F( 1, K/L, H/L, N/L)**
-  This equation shows that productivity (output per worker) depends on:
	-  the level of technology (**A**)
	-  physical capital per worker
	-  human capital per worker 
	-  natural resources per worker
![[Pasted image 20250623113603.png]]

#### Economic Growth and Public Policy:
Next we look at the ways public policy can affect long-run growth in productivity and living standards.

**Saving and Investment:**
-  We can boost productivity by increasing **K**, which requires investment
-  Since resource is scarce, producing more capital requires producing fewer consumption goods.
-  Reducing consumption = increasing saving. This extra saving funds the production of investment goods.
-  Hence, a tradeoff between current and future consumption

**Diminishing Returns and the Catch-Up Effect:**
-  The govt can implement policies that raise saving and investment. Then **K** will rise, causing productivity and living standards to rise.
-  But this faster growth is temporary due to **diminishing returns to capital**: As **K** rises, the extra output from an additional unit of **K** falls . . . 
![[Pasted image 20250623114158.png]]

**The catch-up effect:** the property whereby poor countries tend to grow more rapidly than rich ones.
![[Pasted image 20250623114256.png]]

**Example of the Catch-Up Effect**
-  Over 1960-1990, the U.S and S.Korea devoted a similar share of GDP to investment, so you might expect they would have similar growth performance.
-  But growth was >6% in Korea and only 2% in the U.S
-  Explanation: the catch-up effect.
	In 1960, **K/L** was far smaller in Korea than in the U.S, hence Korea grew faster.

**Investments from Abroad**:
-  To raise **K/L** and hence productivity, wages, and living standards, the govt can also encourage
	-  **Foreign direct investment:** a capital investment (e.g., factory) that is owned and operated by a foreign entity.
	-  **Foreign portfolio investment**: a capital investment financed with foreign money but operated by domestic residents.
-  Some of the returns from these investments flow back to the foreign countries that supplied the funds.
-  Especially beneficial in poor countries that cannot generate enough saving to fund investment projects themselves
-  Also helps poor countries learn state-of-the-art technologies developed in other countries.

**Education:**
-  Government can increase productivity by promoting education-investment in human capital (**H**). e.g., public schools, subsidized loans for college.
-  Education has significant effects: In the U.S, each year of schooling raises a worker's age by 10%
-  But investing in **H** also involves a tradeoff between the present and future: Spending a year in school requires sacrificing a year's wages now to have higher wages later.

**Health and Nutrition:**
-  Health care expenditure is a type of investment in human capital - healthier workers are more productive.
-  In countries with significant malnourishment, raising worker's caloric intake raises productivity:
	-  Over 1962-65, caloric consumption rose 44% in S.Korea, and economic growth was spectacular.
	-  Nobel winner Robert Fogel: 30% of Great Britain's growth from 1790-1980 was due to improved nutrition.

**Property Rights and Political Stability:**
-  Recall: *Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity.* The price system allocates resources to their most efficient uses.
-  This requires respect for **property rights**, the ability of people to exercise authority over the resources they own.
-  In many poor countries, the justice system doesn't work very well:
	-  contracts aren't always enforced.
	-  fraud, corruption go unpunished.
	-  in some, firms bribe govt officials for permits
-  Political instability (e.g., frequent coups) creates uncertainty over whether property rights will be protected in the future.
-  When people fear their capital may be stolen by criminals or confiscated by a corrupt govt, there is less investment, including from abroad, and the economy functions less efficiently. Result: lower living standards.
-  Economic stability, efficiency, and healthy growth require law enforcement, effective courts, a stable constitution, and honest govt officials.

**Free Trade:**
-  **Inward-oriented policies:** (e.g., tariffs, limits on investment from abroad)
aim to raise living standards by avoiding interaction with other countries
-  **Outward-oriented policies**: (e.g., the elimination of restrictions on trade or foreign investment) promote integration with the world economy
-  Recall: *Trade can make everyone better off*
-  Trade has similar effects as discovering new technologies - it improves productivity and living standards
-  Countries with inward-oriented policies have generally failed to create growth. e.g., Argentina during the 20th century
-  Countries with outward-oriented policies have often succeeded. e.g., South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan after 1960

**Research and Development**:
-  Technological progress is the main reason why living standards rise over the long run
-  One reason is that knowledge is a **public good**: Ideas can be shared freely, increasing productivity of many.
-  Policies to promote tech. progress:
	-  patent laws
	-  tax incentives or direct support for private sector R&D 
	-  grants for basic research at universities

**Population Growth:** . . . may effect living standards in 3 different ways

***Stretching natural resources***
-  200 years ago, Malthus argued that population growth would strain society's ability to provide for itself.
-  Since then, the world population has increased sixfold. If Malthus was right, living standards would have fallen. Instead they've risen
-  Malthus failed to account for technological progress and productivity growth

***Diluting the capital stock***
-  more population = higher **L** = lower **K/L** = lower productivity & living standards.
-  This applies to **H** as well as **K**: 
fast population growth =  more children = greater strain on educational system
-  Countries with fast population growth tend to have lower educational attainment.
To combat this, may developing countries use policy to control population growth.
-  China's one child per family
-  contraception education & availability
-  promote female literacy to raise opportunity cost of having babies

***Promoting technological progress***
-  More people 
=> more scientists, inventors, engineers.
=> more frequent discoveries.
=> faster technological progress & economic growth
-  Evidence from Michael Kremer:
Over the course of human history:
-  growth rates increased as the world's population increased
-  more populated regions grew faster than less populated ones

![[Pasted image 20250623122822.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250623122848.png]]

**Are Natural Resources a Limit to Growth ?**
-  Some argue that population growth is depleting the Earth's non-renewable resources, and thus will limit growth in living standards
-  But technological progress often yields ways to avoid these limits:
	-  Hybrid cars use less gas
	-  Better insulation in homes reduces the energy required to heat or cool them
-  As a resource becomes scarcer, its market price rises, which increases the incentive to conserve it and develop alternatives.

## Saving, Investment, and the Financial System:
**In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:**
-  What are the main types of financial institutions in the U.S economy, and what is their function ?
-  What are the three kinds of saving ?
-  What's the difference between saving and investment ?
-  How does the financial system coordinate saving and investment ?
-  How do govt policies affect saving, investment, and the interest rate ?

#### Financial Institutions:
-  The **financial system**: the group of institutions that helps match the saving of one person with the investment of another.
-  **Financial markets**: Institutions through which savers can directly provide funds to borrowers. Examples:
	-  The Bond Market. A **bond** is a certificate of indebtedness
	-  The Stock Market. A **stock** is a claim to partial ownership in a firm
-  **Financial Intermediaries**: Institutions through which savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers. Examples:
	-  Banks
	-  **Mutual Funds** - institutions that sell shares to the public and use the proceeds to buy portfolios of stocks and bonds.

#### Different Kinds of Saving:
**Private Saving**
-  The portion of household's income that is not used for consumption or paying taxes.
	=  Y - T - C
	
**Public Saving**
-  Tax revenue less government spending
	=  T - G

**National Saving**
-  private saving + public saving
	=  Y - C - G
-  the portion of national income that is not used for consumption or government purchases

#### Saving and Investment:
Recall the national income accounting identity : **Y = C + I + G + NX**
For the rest of this chapter, focus on the closed economy case:
**Y = C + I + G**
Solve for **I**:
**I = Y - C - G = (Y - T - C) + (T - G)**
*Saving = investment in a closed economy*

#### Budget Deficits and Surpluses
**Budget surplus**
-  an excess of tax revenue over govt spending
-  **T - G**
-  public saving
**Budget deficit**
-  a shortfall of tax revenue from govt spending
-  **G - T**
-  -(public saving)
![[Pasted image 20250624113614.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250624113653.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250624113707.png]]

#### The Meaning of Saving and Investment:
-  **Private saving** is the income remaining after households pay their taxes and pay for consumption.
-  Examples of what households do with saving:
	-  buy corporate bonds or equities
	-  purchase a certificate of deposit at the bank
	-  buy shares of a mutual fund
	-  let accumulate in saving or checking accounts
-  **Investment** is the purchase of a new capital
-  Examples of investment:
	-  General Motors spends $250 million to build a new factory in Flint, Michigan.
	-  You buy $5000 worth of computer equipment for your business
	-  Your parents spend $300,000 to have a new house built
*Remember: In economics, investment is NOT the purchase of stocks and bonds.*

#### The Market of Loanable Funds:
-  A supply-demand model of the financial system
-  Helps us understand
	-  how the financial system coordinates saving & investment
	-  how govt policies and other factors affect saving, investment, the interest rate.
**Assume: only one financial market**
-  All savers deposit their saving in this market
-  All borrowers take out loans from this market
-  There is one interest rate, which is both the return to saving and the cost of borrowing.
The supply of loanable funds comes from saving:
-  Households with extra income can loan it out and earn interest
-  Public saving, if positive, adds to national saving and the supply of loanable funds. If negative, it reduces national saving and the supply of loanable funds.
![[Pasted image 20250624114801.png]]

The demand for loanable funds comes from investment:
-  Firms borrow the funds they need to pay for new equipment, factories, etc.
-  Households borrow the funds they need to purchase new houses.

![[Pasted image 20250624115013.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250624115022.png]]

#### Budget Deficits, Crowding Out, and Long-Run Growth:
-  Our analysis: increase in budget deficit causes fall in investment. The govt borrows to finance its deficit, leaving less funds available for investment.
-  This is called **crowding out**.
-  Recall from the preceding chapter: Investment is important for long-run economic growth. Hence, budget deficits reduce the economy's growth rate and future standard of living.

#### The U.S. Government Debt
-  The government finances deficits by borrowing (selling government bonds).
-  Persistent deficits lead to a rising govt debt.
-  The ration of govt debt to GDP is a useful measure of the company's indebtedness relative to its ability to raise tax revenue.
-  Historically, the debt-GDP ratio usually rises during wartime and falls during peacetime - until the early 1980s.
![[Pasted image 20250624115604.png]]

-  Like many other markets, financial markets are governed by the forces of supply and demand.
-  One of the Ten Principles from Chapter 1: *Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity.* Financial markets help allocate the economy's scarce resources to their most efficient uses.
-  Financial markets also link the present to the future: They enable savers to convert current income into future purchasing power, and borrowers to acquire capital to produce goods and services in the future.

## The Basic Tools of Finance:
**In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:**
-  What is "present value" ? How can we use it to compare sums of money from different times ?
-  Why are people risk averse ? How can risk-averse people use insurance and diversification to manage risk ?
-  What determines the value of an asset ? What is the "efficient markets hypothesis" ?Why is beating the market nearly impossible ?

#### Introduction:
-  The financial system coordinates saving and investment.
-  Participants in the financial system make decisions regarding the allocation of resources over time and the handling of risk.
-  **Finance** is the field that studies such decision making.

#### Present Value: The Time Value of Money
-  To compare a sums from different times, we use the concept of present value.
-  The **present value** of a future sum: the amount that would be needed today to yield that future sum at prevailing interest rates.
-  Related Concept:
The **future value** of a sum: the amount the sum will be worth at a given future date, when allowed to earn interest at the prevailing rate.

#### Example 1: A Simple Deposit
-  Deposit $100 in the bank at 5% interest. What is the future value (FV) of this amount ?
-  In **N** years, FV = $100(1 + 0.05)***N***
-  In this example, $100 is the present value (PV).
-  In general, **FV = PV(1+r)*N***, where r denotes the interest rate (in decimal form).
-  Solve for **PV** to get: **PV = FV/(1+r)*N***

#### Example 2: Investment Decision
Present value formula: **PV = FV/(1+r)*N***
-  Suppose ***r = 0.06***.
Should General Motors spend $100 million to build a factory that will yield $200 million in ten years ?
Solution:
Find present value of $200 million in 10 years:
PV = ($200 million)/(1.06)10 = $112 million
Since PV > cost of factory, GM should build it.

-  Instead, suppose ***r=0.09***.
PV = ($200 million)/(1.09)10 = $84 million
Since PV < cost of factory, GM should not build it.
***present value helps explain why investment falls when the interest rate rises***
![[Pasted image 20250624150733.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250624150743.png]]

#### Compounding
-  **Compounding**: the accumulation of a sum of money where the interest earned on the sum earns additional interest
-  Because of compounding, small differences in interest rates lead to big differences over time.
-  Example: Buy $1000 worth of Microsoft stock, hold for 30 years.
If rate of return = 0.08, FV = $10,063
If rate of return = 0.10, FV = $17,450

#### The Rule of 70
-  **The Rule of 70**: If a variable grows at a rate of ***x*** percent per year, that variable will double in about 70/***x*** years.
-  Example:
	-  If interest rate is 5%, a deposit will double in 14 years
	-  If interest rate is 7%, a deposit will double in about 10 years.

#### Risk Aversion:
-  Most people are **risk averse** - they dislike uncertainty
-  Example: You are offered the following gamble. Toss a fair coin
	-  If heads, you win $1000
	-  If tails you lose $1000
Should you take this gamble ?
-  If you are risk averse, the pain of losing $1000 would exceed the pleasure of winning $1000, so you should not take this gamble.

![[Pasted image 20250624151850.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250624151859.png]]

#### Managing Risk with Insurance:
-  How insurance works: A person facing a risk pays a fee to the insurance company, which in turn accepts part or all of the risk.
-  Insurance allows risks to be pooled, and can make risk averse people better off:
E.g., it is easier for 10,000 people to each bear 1/10,000 of the risk of a house burning down than for one person to bear the entire risk alone.

#### Two Problems in Insurance Markets:
 **1. Adverse Selection**:  A high-risk person benefits from insurance, so is more likely to purchase it.
 **2. Moral hazard**:  People with insurance have less incentive to avoid risky behavior.
 Insurance companies cannot fully guard against these problems, so they must charge higher prices.
 As a result, low-risk people sometimes forego insurance and lose the benefits of risk-pooling.

#### Measuring Risk:
-  We can measure risk of an asset with the **standard deviation**, a statistic that measures a variable's volatility - how likely it is to fluctuate.
-  The higher the standard of deviation of the asset's return, the greater the risk

#### Reducing Risk through Diversification:
-  **Diversification** reduces the risk by replacing a single risk with a large number of smaller, unrelated risks.
-  A diversified portfolio contains assets whose returns are not strongly related:
	-  Some assets will realize high returns, others low returns.
	-  The high and low returns average out, so the portfolio is likely to earn an intermediate return more consistently than any of the assets it contains.
-  Diversification can reduce **firm-specific risk**, which only a single company.
-  Diversification *cannot* reduce **market risk**, which affects all companies in the stock market.
![[Pasted image 20250624153032.png]]

#### The Tradeoff Between Risk and Return:
-  One of the Ten Principles from Chapter 1: *People face tradeoffs*
-  A tradeoff between risk and return: Riskier assets pay a higher return, on average, to compensate for the extra risk of holding them.
-  *E.g.,* over past 200 years, average real return on stocks, 8%. On short-term govt bonds, 3%.
-  Example: Suppose you are dividing your portfolio between two asset classes.
	-  A diversified group of risky stocks: average return 8%, standard dev. = 20%
	-  A safe asset: return 3%, standard dev. = 0%
-  The risk and return on the portfolio depends on the percentage of each asset class in the portfolio . . .
![[Pasted image 20250624153531.png]]

#### Asset Valuation:
-  When deciding to buy a company's stock, you compare the price of the shares to the value of the company.
	-  If share price < value, the stock is undervalued
	-  If share price = value, the stock is fairly valued
	-  If share price > value, the stock is overvalued
-  It's easy to look up the price. But how does one determine the stock's value ?
![[Pasted image 20250624153932.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250624153941.png]]

-  Value of a share = PV of any dividends the stock will pay + PV of the price you get when you sell the share
-  Problem: When you buy the share, you don't know what the future dividends or prices will be.
-  One way to value a stock: **fundamental analysis**, the study of a company's accounting statements and future prospects to determine it's value

#### The Efficient Markets Hypothesis
-  **Efficient Markets Hypothesis**: the theory that each asset price reflects all publicly available information about the value of the asset.
-  Mutual fund manager
	-  use fundamental analysis to assess value of all publicly traded companies
	-  buy shares when price < value, sell shares when price > value.
	-  continuously monitor and act on any news that affects the valuation of any stock
-  Stock prices determined by supply & demand. In equilibrium,
	-  the number of people who believe a stock is overvalued exactly balances the number who believe it to be undervalued.
	-  the typical person perceives all stocks fairly valued.

#### Informational Efficiency:
-  According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the stock market is **informationally inefficient**: each stock price reflects all available information about the value of the company.
	-  When good news about a company's prospects becomes public, the value of the company rises, so many managers buy lots of shares until the price rises to the new, higher value.
	-  When bad news becomes public, the value of the company falls, so money managers sell the shares until their price falls by the same amount.
-  At any moment, a stock price is the market's best guess of the company's value based on all available information.

#### Random Walk:
-  **Random walk**: the path of a variable whose changes are impossible to predict 
-  The efficient markets hypothesis that stock prices should follow a random walk.
-  According to this theory, the only thing that can move stock prices is news that changes the market's perception of the company's value.
-  Such news is impossible to predict. (Otherwise it wouldn't really be news, and would already be reflected in the stock price)

#### Index Funds vs. Managed Funds:
-  An index fund is a mutual fund that buys all the stocks in a given index.
-  An actively managed mutual fund aims to buy only the best stocks.
-  The efficient markets hypothesis implies that it is impossible to consistently "beat the market".
-  If true, the returns on actively managed funds should not consistently exceed the returns on index funds.
-  In fact, most actively managed funds perform worse than index funds (and have higher fees).

#### Market Irrationality:
-  Economists have argued that stock price movements are partly psychological:
	-  1930s: John Maynard Keynes said stock prices are driven by investor's "animal spirits" - irrational waves of pessimism and optimism
	-  1990s: Fed chair Alan Greenspan said the stock boom reflected "irrational exuberance"
-  Speculative "bubbles" may occur: Someone may be willing to pay more than she thinks a stock is worth if she believes she will be able to sell it for even more in the future.
-  Economists and market watchers debate the importance of departures from rationality:
	-  It's true that stock prices often move in ways that are hard to explain rationally
	-  Yet, it's impossible to know what price movements are "rational"
	-  And if many investors behaved irrationally, there would be profit opportunities for rational investors. Yet, beating the market is nearly impossible.

The efficient markets hypothesis teaches that a stock price should reflect the company's expected future probability.
Fluctuations in the stock market have important macroeconomic implications.

## Unemployment
**In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:**
-  How is the unemployment measured ?
-  What is the "natural rate of unemployment" ?
-  Why are there always some people unemployed ?
-  How is unemployment affected by unions and minimum wage laws ?
-  What is the theory of efficiency wages, and how does it help explain  unemployment ?

#### Labor Force Statistics:
-  Produced by Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in the U.S Dept. of Labor
-  Based on regular survey of 60,000 households
-  Based on "adult population" (16yrs or older)
-  BLS divides population into 3 groups:
	-  **unemployed**: paid employees, self-employed, and unpaid workers in family business
	-  **unemployed**: people not working who have looked for work during previous 4 weeks
	-  **not in the labor force**: everyone else
-  The **labor force** is the total # of workers, including the employed and unemployed.

![[Pasted image 20250624161850.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250624161857.png]]

#### What does U-Rate really measure ?
-  The U-Rate is not a perfect indicator of joblessness or the health of labor market:
	-  excludes discouraged workers
	-  does not distinguish between full-time and part-time work, or people working part-time because full-time jobs are not available.
	-  Also, some people may misreport their work status in the BLS survey.
-  Despite these issues, the U-Rate is still a very useful barometer of the labor market & economy.

#### The Duration of Unemployment
-  Most spells of unemployment are short:
	-  Typically 1/3 of the unemployed people have been unemployed < 5 weeks, 2/3 have been unemployed < 14 weeks
	-  Only 20% have been unemployed > 6 months
-  Yet, most observed unemployment is long term
	-  The small group of long-term unemployed person has fairly little turnover, so it accounts for most of the unemployment observed over time.
-  Knowing these facts help policymakers design better policies to help the unemployed.

#### Cyclical Unemployment vs. the Natural Rate
There's always some unemployment, though the U-Rate fluctuates from year to year
The **natural rate of unemployment**
-  the normal rate of unemployment around which the actual unemployment rate fluctuates
**cyclical unemployment**
-  the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate 
-  associated with business cycles
![[Pasted image 20250624163235.png]]

#### Explaining the Natural Rate: An Overview
Even when the economy is doing well, there is always some unemployment, including:
**frictional unemployment**
-  occurs when the workers spend time searching for the jobs that better suit their skills and tastes
-  short-term for most workers
**structural unemployment**
-  occurs when there are fewer jobs than workers
-  usually longer-term

#### Job Search
-  Workers have different tastes & skills, and jobs have different requirements
-  **Job search** is the process of matching workers with appropriate jobs
-  **Sectoral shifts** are changes in the composition of demand across industries or regions of the country
-  Such shifts displace some workers, who must search for new jobs appropriate for their skills & tastes
-  The economy is always changing, so some frictional unemployment is inevitable.

#### Public Policy and Job Search:
-  Govt employment agencies: give out information about job vacancies to speed up the matching of workers with jobs.
-  Public training programs: aim to equip workers displaced from declining industries with the skills needed in growing industries.

#### Unemployment Insurance:
-  **Unemployment Insurance (UI)**: a govt program that partially protects workers' incomes when they become unemployed
-  UI increases frictional unemployment because *People respond to incentives*.
-  UI benefits and when a worker takes a job, so workers have less incentive to search or take jobs while eligible to receive benefits
-  UI reduces uncertainty over incomes
-  UI gives the unemployed more time to search, resulting in better job matches and thus higher productivity.

![[Pasted image 20250624164406.png]]

**1. Minimum Wage Laws**:
-  The minimum wage may exceed the equilibrium wage for the least skilled or experienced workers, causing structural unemployment.
-  But this group is a small part of the labor force, so the min. wage can't explain most unemployment.

**2. Unions**:
-  **Union**: a worker association that bargains with employers over wages, benefits and working conditions.
-  Unions exert their market power to negotiate higher wages for workers
-  The typical union worker earns 20% higher wages and gets more benefits than a nonunion worker for the same type of work.
-  When unions raise the wage above equilibrium, quantity of labor demanded falls and unemployment results.
-  "Insiders" - workers who remain employed, they are better off
- "Outsiders" - workers who lose their jobs, they are worse off
-  Some outsiders go to non-ionized labor markets, which increases labor supply and reduces wages in those markets.
Are unions good or bad ? Economists disagree
-  **Critics:** Unions are cartels. They raise wages above equilibrium, which causes unemployment and/or depresses wages in non-union labor markets
-  **Advocates**: Unions counter the market power of large firms, make firms more responsive to worker's concerns.

**3. Efficiency Wages**
-  The theory of **efficiency wages**: firms voluntarily pay above-equilibrium wages to boost worker productivity
-  Different versions of efficiency wage theory suggest different reasons why firms pay high wages
Four reasons why firms might pay efficiency wages:
*1. Worker Health*
In less developed countries, poor nutrition is a common problem. Paying higher wages allows workers to eat better, makes them healthier, more productive.
*2. Worker Turnover*
Hiring & Training new workers is costly. Paying higher wages gives workers more incentive to stay, reduces turnover
*3. Worker Quality*
Offering higher wages attracts better job applicants, increases quality of the firm's workforce
*4. Worker Effort*
Workers can work hard or shirk. Shirkers are fired if caught. Is being fired a good deterrent ?
Depends on how hard it is to find another job. If market wage is above equilibrium, there aren't enough jobs to go around, so workers have more incentive to work not shirk.

## The Monetary System
**In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:**
-  What assets are considered "money" ? What are the functions of money ? The types of money ?
-  What is the Federal Reserve ?
-  What role do banks play in the monetary system ? How do banks "create money" ?
-  How doe the Federal Reserve control the money supply ?

#### What Money Is, and Why It's Important ?
-  Without money, trade would require **barter**, the exchange of one good or service for another 
-  Every transaction would require a **double coincidence of wants** - the unlikely occurrence that two people each have the good the other wants.
-  Most people would have to spend time searching for others to trade with = a huge waste of resources.
-  This searching is unnecessary with **money**, the set of assets that people regularly use to buy g&s from other people.

##### The 3 Functions of Money:
-  **Medium of exchange**: an item buyers give to sellers when they want to purchase g&s
-  **Unit of account**: the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts
-  **Store of value**: an item people can use to transfer purchasing power from the present to the future

##### The 2 Kinds of Money:
**Commodity Money**: takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value.
Example: gold coins, cigarettes in POW camps
**Fiat Money**: money without intrinsic value, used as money because of govt decree
Example: the U.S dollar

#### The Money Supply:
-  The **money supply** (or **money stock**): the quantity of money available in the economy
-  What assets should be considered part of the money supply ? Here are two candidates:
	-  **Currency**: the paper bills and coins in the hands of the (non-bank) public
	-  **Demand deposits**: balances in bank accounts that depositors can access on demand by writing a check.

#### Measures of the U.S. Money Supply:
-  **M1**: currency, demand deposits, traveler's checks, and other checkable deposits.        M1 = $1.4 trillion (October 2005)
-  **M2**: everything in M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits, money market mutual funds, and a few minor categories.                                                                      M2 = $6.6 trillion (October 2005)
***The distinction between M1 and M2 will usually not matter when we talk about "the money supply" in this course.***

#### Central Banks & Monetary Policy
-  **Central Bank**: an institution that oversees the banking system and regulates the money supply
-  **Monetary policy**: the setting of the money supply by policymakers in the central bank
-  **Federal Reserve (Fed)**: the central bank of the U.S.

#### Bank Reserves:
-  In a **fractional reserve banking system**, banks keep a fraction of deposits as **reserves**, and use the rest to make loans.
-  The Fed establishes **reserve requirements**, regulations on the minimum amount of reserves that banks must hold against deposits.
-  Banks may hold more than this minimum amount if they choose
-  The **reserve ratio, R**
	-  = fraction of deposits that banks hold as reserves 
	-  = total reserves as a percentage of total

#### Bank T-account
-  **T-account**: a simplified accounting statement that shows a bank's assets & liabilities.
-  Example:
![[Pasted image 20250624172706.png]]

-  Bank's liabilities include deposits, assets include loans & reserves.
-  In this example, notice ***R*** = $10/$100 = 10%

##### Banks and the Money Supply: An Example
Suppose $100 of currency is in circulation.
To determine bank's impact on money supply, we calculate the money supply in 3 different cases:
1.  No banking system
2.  100% reserve banking system: banks hold 100% of deposits as reserves, makes no loans
3.  Fractional reserve banking system

**CASE 1**: no banking system
Public holds the $100 as currency. Money supply = $100

**CASE 2**: 100% reserve banking system
Public deposits the $100 at First National Bank (FNB). FNB holds 100% of deposit as reserves:
![[Pasted image 20250624173310.png]]
Money Supply = 
currency + deposits = $0 + $100 = $100
***In a 100% reserve banking system, banks do not affect size of money supply***

**CASE 3**: fractional reserve banking system
Suppose ***R***=10%. FNB loans all but 10% of the deposit:
![[Pasted image 20250624173520.png]]
Money supply = $190 
depositors have $100 in deposits, borrowers have $90 in currency.

How did the money supply suddenly grow ?
When banks make loans, they create money. The borrower gets
-  $90 in currency (an asset counted in the money supply)
-  $90 in new debt (a liability)
***A fractional reserve banking system creates money, but not wealth***

Suppose borrower deposits the $90 at Second National Bank (SNB).
Initially SNB's T-account looks like this:
![[Pasted image 20250624173857.png]]
If ***R***=10% for SNB, it will loan all but 10% of the deposit.
The borrower deposits the $81 at Third National Bank (TNB).
Initially TNB's T-account looks like this:
![[Pasted image 20250624174023.png]]
If ***R***=10% for TNB, it will loan all but 10% of the deposit.
The process continues, and money is created with each new loan.
![[Pasted image 20250624174137.png]]

## The Money Multiplier
-  **Money Multiplier**: the amount of money the banking system generates system with each dollar of reserves.
-  The money multiplier equals ***1/R***.
- In our example, ***R***=10%, money multiplier = 1/***R***=10. $100 of reserves creates $1,000 of money.
![[Pasted image 20250624174410.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250624174420.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250624174431.png]]

#### The Fed's 3 Tools of Monetary Control
**1. Open-Market Operations (OMOs)**: the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds by the Fed.
-  *To increase money supply*, Fed buys govt bonds, paying with new dollars.
. . . which are deposited in banks, increasing reserves
. . . which banks use to make loans, causing the money supply to expand.
-  *To reduce money supply*, Fed sells govt bonds, taking dollars out of circulation, and the process works in reverse.
-  OMOs are easy to conduct, and are the Fed's monetary policy tool of choice.

**2. Reserve Requirements (RR)**: Affect how money banks can create by making loans
-  *To increase money supply*, Fed reduces RR. Banks make more loans from each dollar of the reserves, which increases money multiplier and money supply.
-  *To reduce money supply*, Fed raises RR, and the process works in reverse.
-  Fed rarely uses reserve requirements to control money supply: Frequent changes would disrupt banking.

**3. The Discount Rate**: the interest rate on loans the Fed makes to banks
-  When banks are running low on reserves, they may borrow reserves from the Fed.
-  *To increase money supply*, Fed can lower discount rate, which encourages banks to borrow more reserves from Fed.
-  Banks can then make more loans, which increases the money supply.
-  *To reduce money supply*, Fed can raise discount rate.
-  The Fed often uses discount lending to provide extra liquidity when financial institutions are in trouble, such as after the stock market crash of Oct. 1987.

#### Problems Controlling the Money Supply
-  If households hold more of their money as currency, banks have fewer reserves make fewer loans, & money supply fails.
-  If banks hold more reserves than required, they make fewer loans, & money supply falls.
-  Yet, Fed can compensate for household & bank behavior to retain fairly precise control over the money supply.

#### Bank Runs and Money Supply
-  A **run on banks**: When people suspect their banks are in trouble, they may "run" to the bank to withdraw their funds, holding more currency and less deposits.
-  Under fractional-reserve banking, banks don't have enough reserves to pay off ALL depositors, hence banks may have to close.
-  Also, banks may make fewer loans & hold more reserves to satisfy depositors.
-  These events increase ***R***, reverse the process of money creation, cause money supply to fall.
-  During 1929-1933, a wave of bank runs and bank closings caused money supply to fall 28%
-  Many economists believe this contributed to the severity of the Great Depression
-  Bank runs not a problem today due to federal deposit insurance.

## Money Growth and Inflation
**In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:**
-  How does the money supply affect inflation and nominal interest rates ?
-  Does the money supply affect real variables like real GDP or the real interest rate ?
-  How is inflation like a tax ?
-  What are the costs of inflation ? How serious are they ?

#### Introduction:
-  This chapter introduces the **quantity theory of money** to explain one of the Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1:
  *Prices rise when the govt prints too much money*
-  Most economists believe the quantity theory is a good explanation of the long run behavior of inflation

#### The Value of Money:
-  ***P*** = the price level (e.g., the CPI or GDP deflator)
***P*** is price of a basket of goods, measured in money.
-  1/***P*** is the value of $1, measured in goods.
-  Example: basket contains one candy bar.
	-  If ***P***=$2, value of $1 is 1/2 candy bar
	-  If ***P***=$3, value of $1 is 1/3 candy bar.
-  Inflation drives up prices, drives down the value of money.

#### The Quantity Theory of Money:
-  Developed in 18th century, by philosopher David Hume, and the classical economists.
-  Advocated more recently by Nobel Prize Laureate Milton Friedman
-  Asserts that the quantity of money determines the value of money.
-  We study this theory using two approaches:
	-  a supply-demand diagram
	-  an equation

**Money Supply (MS)**:
-  In real world, determined by Federal Reserve, the banking system, consumers.
-  In this model, we assume the Fed precisely controls MS and sets it at some fixed amount.
**Money Demand (MD)**:
-  Refers to how much wealth people want to hold in liquid form.
-  Depends on ***P***:
An increase in ***P*** reduces the value of money, so more money is required to buy g&s.
-  Thus, quantity of money demanded is negatively related to the value of money. (These "other things" include real income, interest rates, availability of ATMs.)
![[Pasted image 20250625065523.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250625065533.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250625065545.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250625065555.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250625065605.png]]

#### A Brief Look at the Adjustment Process
Result from graph: Increasing MS causes ***P*** to rise.
How does this work ? Short Version:
-  At the initial ***P***, an increase in MS causes excess supply of money.
-  People get rid of their excess money by spending it on g&s or by loaning it to others, who spend it. Result: Increased demand for goods
-  But supply of goods does not increase, so prices must rise.
(Other things happen in the short run, which we will study in later chapters.)

#### Real vs. Nominal Variables
-  **Nominal variables** are measured in monetary units.
Example: nominal GDP, nominal interest rate (Rate of return measured in \$), nominal wage (\$ per hour worked)
-  **Real variables** are measured in physical units.
Example: real GDP, real interest rate (measured in output), real wage (measured in output).

Prices are normally measured in terms of money
A **relative price** is the price of one good relative to (divided by) another:
Relative prices are measured in physical units, so they are real variables.
Example: pizzas per CD

#### Real vs. Nominal Wage
An important relative price is the relative wage:
***W*** = nominal wage = price of labor, e.g., $15/hour
***P*** = price level = price of g&s, e.g., $5/unit of output
Real wage is the price of labor relative to the price of output:
***W/P*** = 3 units output per hour.

#### The Classical Dichotomy
-  **Classical Dichotomy**: the theoretical separation of nominal and real variables
-  Hume and the classical economists suggested that monetary developments affect nominal variables, but not real variables.
-  If central bank doubles the money supply, Hume & classical thinkers contend 
	-  all nominal variables - including prices - will double
	-  all real variables - including relative prices - will remain unchanged

#### The Neutrality of Money
-  **Monetary Neutrality**: the proposition that changes in the money supply do not affect real variables
-  Doubling money supply causes all nominal prices to double; what happens to relative price ?
-  *The relative price is unchanged*.
-  Similarly, the real wage ***W/P*** remains unchanged, so
	-  quantity of labor supplied does not change
	-  quantity of labor demanded does not change
	-  total employment of labor does not change
-  The same applies to employment of capital and other resources
-  Since employment of all resources is unchanged, total output is also unchanged by money supply.
-  Most economists believe the classical dichotomy and neutrality of money describe the economy in long run.
-  Monetary changes can have important *short-run* effects on real variables.

#### The Velocity of Money:
-  **Velocity of Money**: the rate at which money changes hands
-  Notation:
***P x Y*** = nominal GDP = (price level) x (real GDP)
***M*** = money supply
***V*** = velocity
-  Velocity formula:  **V = (P x Y)/M**
![[Pasted image 20250625071809.png]]

-  **Quantity Equation:** ***M x V = P x Y***

**The Quantity Theory in 5 Steps:**
1.  ***V*** is stable.
2.  So, a change in ***M*** causes nominal GDP to change by the same percentage
3.  A change in ***M*** does not affect ***Y***: money is neutral, ***Y*** is determined by technology and resources
4.  So, ***P*** changes by the same percentage as ***P x Y*** and ***M***.
5.  Rapid money supply growth causes rapid inflation.

![[Pasted image 20250625072155.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250625072205.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250625072214.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250625072224.png]]

#### Hyperinflation
-  Hyperinflation is generally defined as inflation exceeding 50% per month.
-  *Price rises when the government prints too much money*
-  Excessive growth in the money supply always causes hyperinflation.

#### The Inflation Tax:
-  When tax revenue is inadequate and ability to borrow is limited, govt may print money to pay for its spending.
-  Almost all hyperinflations start this way
-  The revenue from printing money is the **inflation tax**: printing money causes inflation, which is like a tax on everyone who holds money.
-  In the U.S., the inflation tax today accounts for less than 3% of total revenue.

#### The Fisher Effect:
-  Rearrange the definition of the real interest rate:
nominal interest rate = inflation rate + real interest rate
-  The real interest rate is determined by saving & investment in the loanable funds market.
-  Money supply growth determines inflation rate.
-  So, this equation shows how the nominal interest rate is determined.
-  In the long run, money is neutral, so a change in the money growth rate affects the inflation rate but not the real interest rate.
-  So, the nominal interest rate adjusts one-for-one with changes in the inflation rate
-  This relationship is called the **Fisher effect** after Irving Fisher, who studied it.

![[Pasted image 20250625073055.png]]

-  The inflation tax applies to people's holdings of money, not their holdings of wealth.
-  The Fisher Effect: an increase in inflation causes an equal increase in the nominal interest rate, so the real interest rate (on wealth) is unchanged.

#### The Costs of Inflation:
-  The inflation fallacy: most people think inflation erodes real incomes.
-  But inflation is a general increase in prices, of the things people buy and things they sell (e.g., their labor)
-  In the long run, real incomes are determined by real variables, not the inflation rate.

![[Pasted image 20250625073414.png]]

-  **Shoe leather Costs**: the resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings.
	-  includes the time and transactions costs of more frequent bank withdrawals
-  **Menu costs**: the costs of changing prices.
	-  printing new menus, mailing new catalogs, etc.
-  **Misallocation of resources from relative-price variability:** Firms don't raise all raise prices at the same time, so relative prices can vary . . . which distorts the allocation of resources.
-  **Confusion & inconvenience**: Inflation changes the yardstick we use to measure transactions. Complicates long-range planning and the comparison of dollar over time.
-  **Tax distortions:** 
Inflation makes nominal income grow faster than real income.
Taxes are based on nominal income, and some are not adjusted for inflation.
So, inflation causes people to pay more taxes even when their real incomes don't increase.

Inflation . . .
-  raises nominal interest rates (Fisher Effect) but not real interest rates.
-  increases saver's tax burdens
-  lowers the after-tax real interest rate.

## Open Economy:
**In this chapter, look for the answers to these questions:**
-  How are international flow of goods and assets related ?
-  What's the difference between the real and nominal exchange rate ?
-  What is "purchasing-power parity", and how does it explain nominal exchange  rates ?

**Introduction:**
-  *Trade can make everyone better off.*
-  This chapter introduces basic concepts of international macroeconomics:
	-  The trade balance (trade deficits, surpluses)
	-  International flows of assets
	-  Exchange rates

**Closed vs. Open Economics:**
-  A **closed economy** does not interact with other economies in the world
-  An **open economy** interacts freely with other economies around the world.

**The Flow of Goods & Services**:
-  **Exports**: domestically-produced g&s sold abroad
-  **Imports**: foreign-produced g&s sold domestically
-  **Net Exports (NX)**, aka the **trade balance** = value of exports - value of imports

**Variables that Influence Net Exports:**
-  Consumer's preferences for foreign and domestic goods
-  Prices of goods at home and abroad
-  Incomes of consumers at home and abroad
-  The exchange rates at which foreign currency trades for domestic currency
-  Transportation costs
-  Govt policies

**Trade Surpluses & Deficits:**
***NX*** measures the imbalance in a country's trade in goods and services:
-  **Trade deficit**: an excess of imports over exports
-  **Trade surplus**: an excess of exports over imports
-  **Balanced trade**: when exports = imports

#### The Flow of Capital:
-  **Net Capital outflow (NCO)**:
domestic resident's purchases of foreign assets minus foreigner's purchase of domestic assets
-  ***NCO*** is also called **net foreign investment**
The flow of capital abroad takes two forms:
-  **Foreign direct investment**: Domestic residents actively manage the foreign investment, e.g., McDonalds opens a fast-food outlet in Moscow
-  **Foreign portfolio investment**: Domestic residents purchase foreign stocks or bonds, supplying "loanable funds" to a foreign firm.
***NCO*** measures the imbalance in a country's trade in assets:
-  When ***NCO***>0, "capital outflow". Domestic purchases of foreign assets exceed foreign purchase of domestic assets.
-  When ***NCO***<0, "capital inflow". Foreign purchases of domestic assets exceed domestic purchases of foreign assets.

**Variables that Influence NCO**:
-  Real interest rates paid on foreign assets
-  Real interest rates paid on domestic assets 
-  Perceived risks of holding foreign assets
-  Govt policies affecting foreign ownership of domestic assets

#### The Equality of NX and NCO:
-  An accounting identity: ***NCO***=***NX***
	-  arises because every transaction that affects ***NX*** also affects ***NCO*** by the same amount (and vice versa)
-  When a foreigner purchases a good from India,
	-  Indian exports and ***NX*** increase
	-  the foreigner pays with currency or assets, so India acquires some foreign assets, causing ***NCO*** to rise.
-  When an Indian citizen buys foreign goods,
	-  Indian imports rise ***NX*** falls
	-  the Indian buyer pays with Indian Rupees or assets, so the other country acquires Indian assets, causing Indian ***NCO*** to fall.

**Saving, Investment, and International Flow of Goods & Assets:**
***Y = C + I + G + NX***      accounting identity
***Y - C - G = I + NX***         rearranging terms
***S = I + NX***     since    ***S = Y - C - G***
***S = I + NCO***   since    ***NX = NCO***
-  When ***S > I***, the excess loanable funds flow abroad in the form of positive net capital outflow.
-  When ***S < I***, foreigners are financing some of the country's investment, and       ***NCO < 0***

**The Nominal Exchange Rate**
-  the rate at which one country's currency trades for another 
-  We express all exchange rates as foreign currency per unit domestic currency
-  Some exchange rates as of 16 July 2008, all per US $
Canadian dollar: 1
Euro: 0.63
Japanese Yen: 104.77
Mexican peso: 10.25

**Appreciation and Depreciation**
-  **Appreciation** (or "strengthening"): an increase in the value of a currency as measured by the amount of foreign currency it can buy
-  **Depreciation** (or "weakening"): a decrease in the value of a currency as measured by the amount of foreign currency it can buy.
-  Examples: During 2007, the U.S. dollar . . .
	-  depreciated 9.5% against Euro
	-  appreciated 1.5% against the S.Korean Won

**The Real Exchange Rate**
-  the rate at which the g&s of one country trade for the g&s of another
-  Real exchange rate = **e x P / P\*** 
where
***P*** = domestic price;  ***P\**** = foreign price (in foreign currency)
***e*** = nominal exchange rate, i.e., foreign currency per unit of domestic currency

**Example With One Good**
-  A big mac costs $2.5 in the U.S., 400 yen in Japan
-  ***e*** = 120 yen per $
-  ***e x P*** = price in yen of a U.S. Big mac
		=  300 yen per U.S Big mac
-  Compute the real exchange rate: 
***(e x P)/(P\*)*** = 0.75 Japanese Big Macs per US Big Mac

**Interpreting the Real Exchange Rate:**
"The real exchange rate = 0.75 Japanese Big Macs per U.S Big Mac"
Correct Interpretation:
To buy a Big Mac in the U.S., the Japanese citizen must sacrifice an amount that could purchase 0.75 Big Macs in Japan.

**The Real Exchange Rate With Many Goods:**
***P*** = U.S. price level, e.g., Consumer Price Index, measures the price of a basket of goods
***P\**** = foreign price level
Real exchange rate 
	=  ***(e x P)/P\****
	= price of a domestic basket of goods relative to price of a foreign basket of goods
-  If the U.S real exchange rate appreciates, U.S. goods become more expensive relative to foreign goods

**The Law of One Price:**
-  the notion that a good should sell for the same price in all markets.
	-  Suppose coffee sells for $4/pound in Seattle and $5/pound in Boston, an can be transported without any cost
	-  There is an opportunity for **arbitrage**, making a quick profit by buying coffee in Seattle and selling it in Boston.
	-  Such arbitrage drives up the price in Seattle and drives down the price in Boston, until the two prices are equal.

#### Purchasing-Power Parity (PPP)
-  a theory of exchange rates whereby a unit of any currency should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all countries
-  based in the law of one price
-  implies that nominal exchange rates adjust to equalize the price of a basket of goods across countries
-  Example: The "basket" contains Big Mac.
***P*** = price of US Big Mac (in dollars)
***P\**** = price of Japanese Big Mac (in yen)
***e*** = exchange rate, yen per dollar
-  According to PPP, ***e x P = P\****
-  Solve for ***e:***  ***e = (P\*)/(P)***

**PPP and Its Implications:**
-  PPP implies that the nominal exchange rate between two countries should be equal the ratio of price levels
-  If the two countries have different inflation rates, then ***e*** will change over time:
	-  If inflation is higher in Mexico than in the U.S, then ***P\**** rises faster than ***P***, so ***e*** rises - then dollar appreciates faster against the peso
	-  and vice-versa.

**Limitations of PPP Theory:**
Two reasons why exchange rates do not always adjust to equalize prices across countries:
-  Many goods cannot be easily traded
	-  Examples: haircuts, going to the movies
	-  Price differences on such goods cannot be arbitraged away
-  Foreign, domestic goods not perfect substitutes
	-  E.g., some US consumers prefer Toyotas over Chevys, or vice versa
	-  Price differences reflect taste differences
-  Nonetheless, PPP works well in many cases, especially as an explanation of long-run trends.
-  For example, PPP implies: the greater a country's inflation rate, the faster its currency should depreciate (relative to a low-inflation country like the US)
-  The data support this prediction . . .
