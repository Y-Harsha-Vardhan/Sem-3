# MicroEconomics:
-  *Microeconomics* focuses in the individual parts of the economy
	-  How households and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets

### Topics:

- Understanding trade-offs and opportunity costs
-  Demand, Supply: Its nature, elasticity and its determinants
-  Putting demand and supply together: An understanding of markets
-  Competition, monopoly and oligopoly
-  Government Policy
-  Some first principles

###### *. . . The word economy comes from a Greek word for "one who manages a household".*

### Ten Principles of Economics:
###### *Economics* is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.
**How People make Decisions:**
-  People face trade-offs
-  The cost of something is what you give up to get it
-  Rational people think at the margin
-  People respond to incentives
**How People Interact:**
-  Trade can make everyone better off
-  Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
-  Governments can sometimes improve economic outcomes
-  A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.
-  Growth of money leads to inflation
-  Society faces a short-run tradeoff between Inflation and Unemployment

##### Principle #1 : People Face Trade-offs.
-  There is no such thing as a "free lunch"
-  To get one thing, we usually have to give up another thing.
	-  Guns v. butter
	-  Food v. clothing
	-  Leisure time v. work
	-  Efficiency v. equity
-  **Efficiency v. Equity**
	-  *Efficiency* means society gets the most that it can from its scarce resources
	-  *Equity* means the benefits of those resources are distributed fairly among the members of society

##### Principle #2 : The Cost of something is What you give up to get it
-  Decisions require comparing costs and benefits of alternatives.
	-  Whether to go to college or work ?
	-  Whether to study or go out on a date ?
	-  Whether to go to class or sleep in ?
-  The *opportunity cost* of an item is what you give up to obtain that item.

##### Principle #3 : Rational people think at the margin
-  *Marginal changes* are small, incremental adjustments to an existing plan of action
-  People make decisions by comparing costs and benefits at the margin

##### Principle #4 : People Respond to Incentives
-  Marginal changes in costs or benefits motivate people to respond
-  The decision to choose one alternative over another occurs when that alternative's marginal benefits exceed its marginal costs

##### Principle #5 : Trade can make everyone better off
-  People gain from their ability to train with one another
-  Competition results in gains from trading
-  Trade allows people to specialize in what they do best

##### Principle #6 : Markets are usually a good way to organize Economic Activity
-  A *market economy* is an economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services
	-  Households decide what to buy and who to work for
	-  Firms decide who to hire and what to produce
-  Adam Smith made the observation that households and firms interacting in markets act as if guided by an "invisible hand"
	-  Because households and firms look at prices when deciding to buy and sell, they unknowingly take into account the social costs of their actions
	-  As a result, prices guide decision makers to reach outcomes that tend to maximize the welfare of society as a whole

##### Principle #7 : Governments can sometimes improve Market Outcomes
-  Markets work only if property rights are enforced.
	-  *Property rights* are the ability of an individual to own and exercise control over a scarce resource
-  *Market failure* occurs when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently
-  When the market fails (breaks down) government can intervene to promote efficiency and equity
-  *Market failure* may be caused by:
	-  an *externality*, which is the impact of one person or firm's actions on the well-being of a bystander
	-  *market power*, which is the ability of a single person or firm to unduly influence market prices

### Economic Models
-  Economists use models to simplify reality in order to improve our understanding of the world.
-  The two most basic economic models are:
	-  The Circular Flow Diagram
	-  The Production Possibilities Frontier

#### The Circular Low Diagram:
The *circular-flow diagram* is a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through markets among households and firms.

![[Pasted image 20250613064616.png]]

-  Firms
	-  Produce and sell goods and services
	-  Hire and use factors of productions
-  Households
	-  Buy and consume goods and services
	-  Own and sell factors of production
-  Markets for Goods and Services
	-  Firms sell
	-  Households buy
-  Markets for Factors of Production
	-  Households sell
	-  Firms buy
-  Factors of Production
	-  Inputs used to produce goods and services
	-  Land, labor and capital

#### The Production Possibilities Frontier:
The *production possibilities frontier* is a graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology

![[Pasted image 20250613065451.png]]

-  Concepts illustrated by the production possibilities frontier
	-  Efficiency, Trade-offs, Opportunity cost, Economic growth

![[Pasted image 20250613065719.png]]

#### Positive versus Normative Analysis
-  *Positive statements* are statements that attempt to describe the world as it is.             Called descriptive analysis. It is an assertion about how the world is.
-  *Normative statements* are statements about how the world should be.                        Called prescriptive analysis. It is an assertion about how the world ought to be.


### The Market Forces of Supply and Demand:

*Supply and demand are the forces that make market economies work. Modern microeconomics is about supply, demand and market equilibrium.*

A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular good or service. The terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people . . . as they interact with one another in markets.
Buyers determine *demand*.  Sellers determine *supply*.
A *competitive market* is a market in which there are many buyers and sellers so that each has a negligible impact on the market price.

Perfect Competition:
-  Products are the same
-  Numerous buyers and sellers so that each has no influence over price
-  Buyers and sellers are price takers

Monopoly: One seller, and controls selling control prices

Oligopoly:
-  Few sellers
-  Not always aggressive competition

Monopolistic Competition:
-  Many sellers
-  Slightly differentiated products
-  Each seller may set a price for its own product

## Demand:
-  *Quantity demanded* is the amount of good that buyers are willing and able to purchase.
-  **Law of Demand**
	-  The *law of demand* states that, other things equal, the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises.

#### The Demand Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity demanded.

-  **Demand Schedule**
	-  The *demand schedule* is a table that shows the relationship between the price of the good and the quantity demanded.
	-  The *demand curve* is a graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded.
	
![[Pasted image 20250614083427.png]]

-  Market demand refers to the sum of all individual demands for a particular good or service.
-  Graphically, individual demand curves are summed horizontally to obtain the market demand curve.

![[Pasted image 20250614083622.png]]

-  **Change in Quantity Demanded**
	-  Movement along the demand curve
	-  Caused by a change in the price of the product.

![[Pasted image 20250614083811.png]]

-  **Shifts in the Demand Curve**
	-  Consumer income
	-  Prices of related goods
	-  Tastes
	-  Expectations
	-  Number of buyers
-  **Change in Demand**
	-  A shift in the demand curve, either to the left or right.
	-  Caused by any change that alters the quantity demanded at every price.

![[Pasted image 20250614084148.png]]

-  **Consumer Income**
	-  As income increases the demand for a *normal good* will increase.
	-  As income increases the demand for an *inferior good* will decrease.

![[Pasted image 20250614084335.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250614084359.png]]

-  **Prices of Related Goods**
	-  When a fall in the price of one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are called *substitutes*.
	-  When a fall in the price of one good increases the demand for another good, the two goods are called *complements*.

![[Pasted image 20250614084644.png]]

## Supply
-  *Quantity supplied* is the amount of good that sellers are willing and able to sell.
-  **Law of Supply**
	-  The *law of supply* states that, other things equal, the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises.

### The Supply Curve: The Relationship between Price and Quantity Supplied

-  **Supply Schedule**
	-  The *supply schedule* is a table that shows the relationship between the price of the good and the quantity supplied.
-  **Supply Curve**
	-  The supply curve is the graph of the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity supplied.

![[Pasted image 20250614085134.png]]

-  Market Supply refers to the sum of all individual supplies for all sellers of a particular good or service.
-  Graphically, individual supply curves are summed horizontally to obtain the market supply curve.
-  **Shifts in Supply Curve**
	-  Input prices
	-  Technology
	-  Expectations
	-  Number of sellers
-  **Change in Quantity Supplied**
	-  Movement along the supply curve
	-  Caused by a change in anything that alters the quantity supplied 

![[Pasted image 20250614091155.png]]

-  **Change in Supply**
	-  A shift in the supply curve, either to the left or right
	-  Caused by a change in a determinant other than price.

![[Pasted image 20250614091310.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614091343.png]]

## Supply and Demand Together:
-  *Equilibrium* refers to a situation in which the price has reached the level where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded
-  *Equilibrium Price*
	-  The price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded
	-  On a graph, it is the price at which the supply and demand curves intersect.
-  *Equilibrium Quantity*
	-  The quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price.
	-  On a graph it is the quantity at which the supply and demand curves intersect

![[Pasted image 20250614091723.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614091744.png]]

## Equilibrium:

-  ***Surplus***
	-  When price > equilibrium price, then quantity supplied > quantity demanded.
		-  There is excess supply or a surplus
		-  Suppliers will lower the price to increase sales, thereby moving toward equilibrium.
![[Pasted image 20250614092007.png]]

-  ***Shortage***
	-  When price < equilibrium price, then quantity demanded > the quantity supplied.
		-  There is excess demand or shortage
		-  Suppliers will raise the price due to too many buyers chasing too few goods, thereby moving toward equilibrium.

![[Pasted image 20250614092201.png]]

- ***Law of supply and demand***
	-  The claim that the price of any good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded for that good into balance.

![[Pasted image 20250614092331.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614092405.png]]

- **Shifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves**
	-  A shift in the supply curve is called a change in supply.
	-  A movement along a fixed supply curve is called a change in demand.
	-  A shift in the demand curve is called a change in demand
	-  A movement along a fixed demand curve is called a change in quantity demanded.

![[Pasted image 20250614092637.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250614092658.png]]


## The Elasticity of Supply:
*Price elasticity of supply* is a measure of how much the quantity supplied of a good responds to a change in the price of that good.
Price elasticity of supply is the percentage change in quantity supplied resulting from a percentage change in price.

![[Pasted image 20250617102823.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617102848.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617102919.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617102944.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617103025.png]]

***The Price Elasticity of Supply and its Determinants:***
-  Ability of sellers to change the amount of the good they produce.
	-  Beach-front land is inelastic.
	-  Books, cars, or manufactures goods are elastic.
-  Time Period
	-  Supply is more elastic in the long run.

***Computing the Price Elasticity of Supply***
-  The price elasticity of supply is computed as the percentage change in the quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in price.
![[Pasted image 20250617103436.png]]

***What happens to wheat farmers and the market for wheat when university agronomists discover a new wheat hybrid that is more productive than existing varieties ?***

![[Pasted image 20250617103708.png]] 
# The Demand is Inelastic

***Why Did OPEC Fail to Keep the Price of Oil High ?***
Supply and Demand can behave differently in the short run and the long run
-  In the short run, both supply and demand for oil are relatively inelastic.
-  But in the long run, both are elastic

#### Elasticity . . .
***. . . allows us to analyze supply and demand with greater precision.***
***. . . is a measure of how much buyers and sellers respond to changes in market conditions.***

## The Elasticity of Demand
-  The *price elasticity of demand* is a measure of how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in the price of that good.
-  When we talk about *elasticity*, that responsiveness is always measured in percentage terms.
-  Specifically, the price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded due to a percentage change in the price.
-  The price elasticity of demand is computed as the percentage change in the price.
![[Pasted image 20250617104637.png]]

#### The Price Elasticity of Demand and its Determinants:
-  Availability of Close substitutes
-  Necessities versus Luxuries
-  Definition of the Market
-  Time Horizon

**Demand tends to be more elastic:**
-  the larger the number of close substitutes.
-  if the good is a luxury
-  the longer the time period

***The Midpoint Method:*** *A Better Way to Calculate Percentage Changes and Elasticities*
The midpoint formula is preferable when calculating the price elasticity of demand because it gives the same answer regardless of the direction of the price change.
![[Pasted image 20250617105222.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617105247.png]]

### The Variety of Demand Curves:
-  ***Inelastic Demand***
	-  Quantity demanded does not respond strongly to price changes
	-  Absolute Value of Price elasticity of demand is between 0 and 1.
-  ***Elastic Demand***
	-  Quantity demanded responds strongly to changes in price
	-  Absolute Value of Price elasticity of demand is greater than one.

![[Pasted image 20250617110216.png]]

#### The Variety of Demand Curves
-  ***Perfectly Inelastic*** : Quantity demanded does not respond to price changes
-  ***Perfectly Elastic*** : Quantity demanded changes infinitely with any change in price
-  ***Unit Elastic*** : Quantity demanded changes by the same percentage as the price

![[Pasted image 20250617110459.png]]

-  Because the price elasticity of demand measures how much quantity demanded responds to the price, it is closely related to the slope of the demand curve.
-  But it is not the same thing as the slope.

![[Pasted image 20250617110845.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250617110909.png]]

***Why not just use the slope of a demand curve to measure the sensitivity of quantity demanded to a change in a commodity's own price ?***
*Because the value of sensitivity then depends upon the (arbitrary) units of measurement used for quantity demanded.*

### Total Revenue and the Price Elasticity of Demand:
***Total Revenue*** is the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers of a good.
Computed as the price of the good times the quantity sold.
#####        **TR = P X Q**

![[Pasted image 20250617111827.png]]

#### Elasticity and Total Revenue along a Linear Demand Curve
With an inelastic demand curve, an increase in price leads to a decrease in quantity that is proportionately smaller. Thus, total revenue increases.
**How Total Revenue Changes When Price Changes :**
**Inelastic Demand**
![[Pasted image 20250617112104.png]]

With an elastic demand curve, an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded that is proportionately larger. Thus, *total revenue decreases*.

## Other Demand Elasticities

#### Income Elasticity of Demand
-  *Income elasticity of demand* measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumer's income.
-  It is computed as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
**Computing Income Elasticity**
![[Pasted image 20250617112808.png]]
***Remember, all elasticities are measured by dividing one percentage change by another***
**Types of Goods**
-  Normal Goods: Income elasticity is positive
-  Inferior Goods: Income elasticity is negative
*Higher income raises the quantity demanded for normal goods, but lowers the quantity demanded for inferior goods*
-  Good consumers regard as necessities tend to be income inelastic
	-  Examples include food, fuel, clothing, utilities, and medical services
-  Good consumers regard as luxuries tend to be income elastic
	-  Examples include sports cars, furs, and expensive foods

#### Cross-price elasticity of demand
A measure of how much the quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price if another good, computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded of the first good divided by the percentage change in the price of the second good
-  For complements, cross price elasticity is negative
-  For substitutes, cross price elasticity is positive
![[Pasted image 20250617113758.png]]

## Supply, Demand and Government Policies:
In a free, unregulated market system, market forces establish prices and exchange quantities.
While equilibrium conditions may be efficient, it may be true that not everyone is satisfied.
One of the roles of economists is to use their theories to assist in the development of policies.

***Controls on Prices:***
-  Are usually enacted when policy makers believe the market price is unfair to buyers or sellers.
-  Result in government-created price ceilings and floors.
-  *Price Ceiling*: A legal **maximum** on the price at which a good can be sold.
-  *Price Floor*: A legal **minimum** on the price at which a good can be sold.

**How Price Ceilings Affect Market Outcomes:**
-  Two outcomes are possible when the government imposes a price ceiling:
	-  The price ceiling is not binding if set above the equilibrium price
	-  The price ceiling is binding if set below the equilibrium price, leading to a shortage.

![[Pasted image 20250618100718.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618100739.png]]

-  ***A binding price ceiling creates***
	-  Shortages because $Q_D$>$Q_S$
		-  Example: Gasoline shortage of the 1970s
	-  Nonprice rationing
		-  Examples: Long lines, discrimination by sellers

#### Case Study: Rent Control in the Short Run and Long Run
-  Rent controls are ceilings placed on the rents that landlords may charge their tenants.
-  The goal of rent control policy is to help the poor by making housing more affordable.
![[Pasted image 20250618101249.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618101302.png]]

**How Price Floors affect Market Outcomes:**
When the government imposes a price floor, two outcomes are possible:
-  The price floor is not binding if set below the equilibrium price.
-  The price floor is binding if set above the equilibrium price, leading to a surplus.

![[Pasted image 20250618103823.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618103840.png]]

-  A price floor prevents supply and demand from moving toward the equilibrium price and quantity.
-  When the market price hits the floor, it can fall no further, and the market price equals the floor price.

#### Case Study: The Minimum Wage
-  An important example of a price floor is the minimum wage.
-  Minimum wage laws dictate the lowest price possible for labor that any employer may pay.
![[Pasted image 20250618104149.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618104204.png]]

## Taxes:
***Governments levy taxes to raise revenue for public projects***

**How taxes on buyers (and sellers) affect Market outcomes:**
-  Taxes discourage market activity
-  When a good is taxed, the quantity sold is smaller
-  Buyers and sellers share the tax burden
-  **Elasticity and Tax incidence:**
	-  *Tax Incidence* is the manner in which the burden of a tax is shared among participants in a market.
	-  Tax incidence is the study of who bears the burden of a tax
	-  Taxes result in a change in market equilibrium
	-  Buyers pay more and sellers receive less, regardless of whom tax is levied on.
![[Pasted image 20250618104642.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618104700.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250618104810.png]]

***In what proportions is the burden of the tax divided ?***
***How do the effects of taxes on sellers compare to those levied on buyers ?***
*The answers to these questions depend on the elasticity of demand and the elasticity of supply.*

![[Pasted image 20250618105032.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618105043.png]]

***The burden of a tax falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elastic.***

## The Costs of Production

**What are Costs ?**
-  According to the **Law of Supply**:
	-  Firms are willing to produce and sell a greater quantity of a good when the price of the good is high
	-  This results in a supply curve that slopes upward.
-  The Firm's Objective:
	-  The economic goal of the firm is to **maximize profits**.

***Total Revenue***: The amount a firm receives for the sale of its output.
***Total Cost***: The market value of the inputs a firm uses in production.
***Profit*** is the firm's total revenue minus its total cost.
**Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost**

**Costs as Opportunity Costs:**
-  A firm's cost of production includes all the opportunity costs of making its output of goods and services.
-  Explicit and Implicit Costs
	-  A firm's cost of production include *explicit costs* and *implicit costs*:
		-  Explicit costs are input costs that require a direct outlay of money by the firm.
		-  Implicit costs are input costs that do not require an outlay of money by the firm.

**Economic Profit versus Accounting Profit:**
-  Economists measure a firm's *economic profit* as total revenue minus total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs.
-  Accountants measure the *accounting profit* as the firm's total revenue minus only the firm's explicit costs.
-  When total revenue exceeds both explicit and implicit costs, the firm earns economic profit.
-  Economic profit is smaller than accounting profit.
![[Pasted image 20250618110336.png]]

**Production and Costs:**
-  **The Production Function:**
	-  The *production function* shows the relationship between quantity of inputs used to make a good and the quantity of output of that good.
-  **Marginal Product:**
	-  The *marginal product* of any input in the production process is the increase in output that arises from an additional unit of that input.

#### Production Function:
*Diminishing marginal product* is the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases.
-  Example: As more and more of workers are hired at a firm, each additional worker contributes less and less to production because the firm has a limited amount of equipment.
![[Pasted image 20250618110900.png]]

#### Diminishing Marginal Product:
-  The slope of production function measures the marginal product of an input, such as a worker.
-  When the marginal product declines, the production function becomes flatter.

**From the Production Function to the Total-Cost Curve:**
-  The relationship between the quantity a firm can produce and its costs determine pricing decisions
-  The total-cost curve shows this relationship graphically.
![[Pasted image 20250618111155.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618111209.png]]

#### The Various Measure of Cost:
Costs of production may be divided into *fixed costs* and *variable costs*.
-  **Fixed costs** are those costs that *do not vary* with the quantity of output produced.
-  **Variable costs** are those costs that *do vary* with the quantity of output produced.
**Total Costs:**
-  Total Fixed Costs (TFC)
-  Total Variable Costs (TVC)
-  Total Costs (TC)
-  TC = TFC + TVC
![[Pasted image 20250618111559.png]]

**Average Costs:**
-  Average costs can be determined by dividing the firm's costs by the quantity of output it produces.
-  The average cost is the cost of each typical unit of product.
-  Average Costs:
	-  Average Fixed Costs (AFC)
	-  Average Variable Costs (AVC)
	-  Average Total Costs (ATC)
	-  ATC = AFC + AVC
-  AFC = (Fixed Cost)/(Quantity) = FC/Q
-  AVC = (Variable Cost)/(Quantity) = VC/Q
-  ATC = (Total Cost)/(Quantity) = TC/Q

**Marginal Cost**
-  *Marginal Cost* (MC) measures the increase in total cost that arises from an extra unit of production.
-  Marginal Cost helps answer the following question:
	-  *How much does it cost to produce an additional unit of output ?*
-  MC = (change in total cost)/(change in quantity) = ($\Delta$TC)/($\Delta$Q)
![[Pasted image 20250618112248.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250618112300.png]]

-  Marginal cost rises with the amount of output produced
	-  This reflects the property of diminishing marginal product.
-  Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Total Cost
	-  Whenever marginal cost is less than average total cost, average total cost is falling.
	-  Whenever marginal cost is greater than average total cost, average total cost is rising.
	-  The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the efficient scale.
		-  *Efficient scale* is the quantity that minimizes average total cost.
![[Pasted image 20250618112636.png]]

-  Three Important Properties of Cost Curves:
	-  Marginal cost eventually rises with the quantity of output.
	-  The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of average total cost.

**Cost Curves and Their Shapes:**
-  The average total-cost curve is U-shaped.
-  At very low levels of output average total cost is high because fixed cost is spread over only a few units.
-  Average total cost declines as output increases.
-  Average total cost starts rising because average variable cost rises substantially.
-  The bottom of the U-shaped ATC curve occurs at the quantity that minimizes average total cost. This quantity is sometimes called the ***efficient scale of the firm.***

**Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run:**
-  For many firms, the division of total costs between fixed and variable costs depends on the time horizon being considered.
	-  In the short run, some costs are fixed.
	-  In the long run, all *fixed costs* become variable costs.
-  Because many costs are fixed in the short run but variable in the long run, a firm's long-run cost curves differ from its short-run cost curves.
