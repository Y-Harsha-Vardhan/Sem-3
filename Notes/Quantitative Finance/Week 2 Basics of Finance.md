# Introduction to Stock Markets

## (a) INVESTMENTS:

### **What?**

Investing is buying assets to generate income or increase in value over time. Common investments include stocks, bonds, real estate, or alternatives like cryptocurrency and gold.

### **Why?**

Investing helps beat inflation, generates passive income, offers tax benefits, and supports financial goals. While it involves risk, a diversified, long-term approach can reduce that risk and harness market growth effectively.

### **Where?**

The 4 most popular asset classes are:

1. **Fixed income instruments:** Consider government and corporate bonds, CDs, and Treasury bills for stable income and capital preservation.
2. **Equity**: Involves buying shares of publicly listed companies. Invest in stocks or equity mutual funds for potential capital appreciation and dividends, but be prepared for market fluctuations.
3. **Real estate**: Purchase properties or invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs) for rental income and potential property value appreciation.
4. **Commodities (Bullion):** Explore precious metals like gold and silver as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.

### **What to consider?**

1. Risk and return are linked: Higher risk often leads to higher returns, while lower risk entails lower returns.
2. Fixed-income investments protect the principal but may lose value when adjusted for inflation. Corporate fixed-income instruments carry higher risk.
3. Equities have a good track record of beating inflation with historical returns of around 14-15%. However, they come with a higher risk.
4. Real estate investment requires substantial upfront investment and lacks liquidity
5. Gold and silver are relatively safer investments, but historical returns have not been consistently high
6. By understanding these factors, you can make informed investment decisions aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals.

## (b) STOCKS & STOCK MARKET:

### **What are stocks?**

Stocks, also called shares or equities, represent small pieces of ownership in a company. When a company needs money to grow or operate, it can “issue” stocks to the public. By buying a stock, you become a shareholder and own a fraction of that company and are entitled to a share of the company's assets. Capital appreciation (the rise in stock value over time) and dividends (the distribution of a portion of a company's profits to shareholders) are two ways that investing in stocks may yield rewards.

### **What is the Stock Market?**

The stock market is a centralized platform where investors trade stocks and other assets, and companies raise capital by selling shares. Prices fluctuate based on company performance, economic indicators, global events, and investor sentiment. Investors use the market for long-term growth, short-term trading, or diversification—seeking capital gains or dividends depending on their goals.

## (c) MARKET PARTICIPANTS:

1. **Retail investors:** Individual traders who buy and sell shares for their personal portfolios.
2. **Institutional investors**: Large organizations (e.g., mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies) that invest substantial sums on behalf of clients or beneficiaries.
3. **Regulators:** Government agencies (such as the Securities and Exchange Board) that set rules, monitor compliance, and protect investor interests.
4. **Market intermediaries:** Brokers, dealers, and investment banks that facilitate buying, selling, and settlement of securities.
5. **Stock Exchanges:** Centralized platforms (e.g., NSE, BSE) where listed securities are matched between buyers and sellers.

## (d)HOW DO STOCK PRICES CHANGE?

- Supply & Demand: High demand with limited supply drives prices up; excess supply lowers prices
- Company Performance: Strong earnings, new products, or successful deals boost prices; poor results or controversies drag them down
- Economic Conditions: Low interest rates, low inflation, and strong GDP support higher stock prices; weak economies do the opposite
- Industry Trends: Sector-wide innovations or demand surges lift related stocks; competition or declining trends pull them down.
- Investor Sentiment: Emotions, speculation, and trends can cause short-term price swings regardless of fundamentals.
- Political & Geopolitical Events: Policy changes, regulations, or global tensions create uncertainty, often increasing volatility

Stock prices are driven by a complex mix of factors and can be highly unpredictable. Investors use different strategies to analyse these elements and anticipate price changes. To better grasp how buy/sell actions impact prices, explore:

1. **Order Book**: A real-time record of all buy (bid) and sell (ask) orders, organised by price. Watching how orders are placed, cancelled, or filled reveals short-term price pressure.
2. **Bid-Ask Spread:** The spread is the difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask. A tight spread = high liquidity; a wide spread = low volume or uncertainty. Spreads often widen during news events, affecting costs and volatility.

## (f)STOCK MARKET INDEX:

A stock market index is a pre-selected group of stocks, compiled and monitored to reflect the broader market’s performance, acting as a sentiment barometer for the economy.

### Why does it matter?

1. Information - They indicate whether investors are optimistic (rising) or pessimistic (falling)
2. Benchmarking - Compare your portfolio’s returns against an index to gauge performance.
3. Trading - Traders use index futures and options to speculate on broad market moves or react to events like budget announcements.
4. Hedging - Investors can hedge portfolio risk using index derivatives during expected downturns.

### How are they constructed?

A stock must meet certain criteria to be included. Each stock in the index has a weight, which shows how much it influences the index’s movement. There are many ways to assign weights, but the Indian stock exchange follows a free-float market capitalization method. The weights are assigned based on the company’s free-float market capitalization. The larger the market capitalization, the higher the weight. Free float market capitalization is the product of the total number of shares outstanding in the market and the stock price.

For example, company ABC has 100 shares outstanding in the market, and the stock price is at 50, then the free-float market cap of ABC is 100*50 = Rs . 5,000.

# Technical Analysis

## (a)WHAT IS IT?

Unlike fundamental analysis, where you research a few companies thoroughly, technical analysis is where one scans for opportunities based on the current trend, i.e. the market’s preference. The actions of market participants can be visualised in stock charts. Over time, patterns form in these charts, and each pattern conveys a certain message. It is important to set expectations on what can and cannot be achieved with technical analysis.

1. Trades – TA is best used to identify short-term trades. Do not use TA to identify long-term investment opportunities; they are best identified using fundamental analysis
2. Return per trade – TA-based trades are usually short-term in nature. Do not expect huge returns within a short duration of time
3. Holding Period – Trades based on technical analysis can last between a few minutes to a few weeks, usually not beyond that
4. Risk ­– TA-based trades are short-term; if the trade goes bad, do remember to cut the losses and move on to identify the next opportunity

Some assumptions made in TA are:

1. **Markets discount everything -** that all known and unknown information in the public domain is reflected in the latest stock price
2. **The ‘how’ is more important than the ‘why’ -**  a technical analyst would not be interested in questioning why an insider bought the stock as long as the technical analyst knows how the price reacted to the insider’s action.
3. **Price moves in trend -** once a trend is established the price moves in the direction of the trend
4. **History tends to repeat itself-** This happens because the market participants consistently react to price movements in remarkably similar ways every time the price moves in a certain direction.

## (b)SOME TERMINOLOGIES:

1. Open Price(O) – When the markets open for trading, the first price a trade executes is called the opening price.
2. The High Price(H) – This is the highest price at which a trade occurred for the given day.
3. The Low Price(L) – This is the lowest price at which a trade occurred for the given day.
4. The Close Price(C) – This is the most important price because it is the final price at which the market closes for the day. The close indicates the intraday strength and a reference price for the next day. The closing price also shows the market sentiment and serves as a reference point for the next day’s trading.

## (c) JAPANESE CANDLESTICKS

Before we get to candlesticks, we will understand why we don’t use the other chart types, like line and bar charts. Using a line chart, the trader can identify the general trend of the security, but it takes into consideration only the closing prices, ignoring the open, high and low. For this reason, traders prefer not to use the line charts. The bar chart is a bit more versatile as it displays all four price variables: open, high, low, and close, but it lacks a visual appeal. (For reading bar charts, [check](https://hdfcsky.com/sky-learn/share-trading/bar-chart-in-stock-market))

The candlestick, like a bar chart, is made of 3 components.

1. The Central real body – The real body, rectangular, connects the opening and closing price.
2. Upper shadow – Connects the high point to the close (in bullish candle and open in bearish).
3. Lower Shadow – Connects the low point to the open (in bullish candle and close in bearish).

## (d) TECHNICAL INDICATORS:

Technical indicators are mathematical calculations applied to price, volume, etc., in order to help traders identify potential market opportunities and make more informed decisions. Broadly speaking, they fall into four main categories:

1. **Momentum‐based indicators:**

They measure the speed and strength of price movements to signal when an asset may be overbought or oversold (e.g., RSI, Stochastic Oscillator).

1. T**rend‐based indicators:**

They help determine the overall direction of a market by smoothing out price data and highlighting whether a security is in an uptrend, downtrend, or ranging (e.g., Moving Averages, MACD).

[Trend Trading: The 4 Most Common Indicators](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/041814/four-most-commonlyused-indicators-trend-trading.asp)

1. **Volume‐based indicators:**

They analyze trading volume alongside price action to confirm the validity of trends or to identify possible reversals (e.g., On‐Balance Volume, Accumulation/Distribution Line).

[9 Essential Volume Indicators For Smart Trading](https://blog.elearnmarkets.com/volume-indicator/)

1. **Volatility‐based indicators:**

They quantify the rate at which price changes over time, allowing traders to gauge market uncertainty and potential breakout points (e.g., Bollinger Bands, Average True Range).

# Introduction to strategies

Finding a trading idea is easy - there are hundreds available for free in finance books, academic papers, blogs, and forums, often with full methods and backtest results. The real work starts when you try to make those ideas actually profitable. Most public strategies fail under serious backtesting, but strong ones often come from simple concepts, especially when you combine technical indicators wisely. Trading strategies rely on technical analysis, fundamental analysis, market trends, momentum, mean reversion, arbitrage, and breakout setups. They work best when prices trend or revert to a long-term average - if prices move randomly, strategies won’t work. Good traders test their strategy on different time frames, understand how each indicator gives signals (like MACD, RSI, or Stochastic), and only then combine them to reduce false signals and improve confidence.

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a versatile trading indicator that has stood the test of time. It is frequently used with Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Stochastic and Supports & Resistances. Check the following article to find how you can effectively combine one indicator with another to improve your trading strategy.

[Three of the Best MACD Trading Strategies | FXOpen](https://fxopen.com/blog/en/three-of-the-best-macd-trading-strategies/)

It’s important to note, however, that assets don't always behave in the same way. For this reason, before implementing any strategy made up of a combination of indicators, it is strongly advised to backtest it for a few months in order to check if it can be profitable for a specific asset, as well as which time frames are more suitable to trade with.

## Combining indicators

No single indicator provides perfect signals, so traders often use two or more tools together.

# Discounting

## **1. Time Value of Money**

### **Definition**

The time value of money is the concept that money available today is worth more than the same amount of money in the future due to its potential earning capacity.

### **Core Principles**

- **Opportunity Cost:** Money today can be invested to earn returns
- **Inflation:** Money loses purchasing power over time
- **Risk:** Future payments are uncertain
- **Liquidity Preference:** People prefer having money now rather than later

### **Basic Formula**

Present Value (PV) = Future Value  $(FV) / (1 + r)^n$

Where:
- PV = Present Value (today's value)
- FV = Future Value (amount in the future)
- r = discount rate (interest rate)
- n = number of periods

### **Example**

If you're promised $1,000 in 3 years and the discount rate is 5%:
PV = $ $1,000 / (1.05)^3$ = $ $1,000 / 1.157625 =$ $ $863.84$

This means $1,000 received in 3 years is worth $863.84 today.

---

## **2. Discount Rate**

### **Definition**

The discount rate is the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows. It represents the required rate of return or cost of capital.

### **Components of Discount Rate**

- **Risk-free rate:** Return on government bonds (baseline)
- **Risk premium:** Additional return demanded for taking risk
- **Inflation premium:** Compensation for expected inflation
- **Liquidity premium:** Compensation for illiquidity

### **Types of Discount Rates**

- **Nominal Rate:** Includes inflation effects
- **Real Rate:** Adjusted for inflation (Real Rate = Nominal Rate - Inflation)
- **Risk-adjusted Rate:** Incorporates risk factors

### **Rate Selection Guidelines**

- **Government bonds:** Use Treasury rates
- **Corporate bonds:** Use corporate bond yields
- **Equity investments:** Use CAPM or higher rates (8-12%)
- **Risky projects:** Add risk premiums (15-20%+)

---

## **3. Present Value Calculations**

### **Single Cash Flow**

$PV = CF / (1 + r)^n$

Where CF = Cash Flow in period n

### **Multiple Cash Flows**

For uneven cash flows, discount each separately:

$PV = CF₁/(1+r)¹ + CF₂/(1+r)² + CF₃/(1+r)³ + ... + CFₙ/(1+r)ⁿ$

### **Example: Multiple Cash Flows**

Cash flows: Year 1: $500, Year 2: $600, Year 3: $700
Discount rate: 8%

PV = $500/(1.08)¹ + $600/(1.08)² + $700/(1.08)³
PV = $462.96 + $514.40 + $555.83 = $1,533.19

---

## **4. Annuities**

### **Definition**

An annuity is a series of equal payments made at regular intervals.

### **Types of Annuities**

1. **Ordinary Annuity:** Payments at end of each period
2. **Annuity Due:** Payments at beginning of each period

### **Present Value of Ordinary Annuity**

$PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^{-n}) / r]$

Where:
- PMT = Payment amount
- r = discount rate per period
- n = number of payments

### **Present Value of Annuity Due**

$PV = PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^{-n}) / r] × (1 + r)$

### **Example: Ordinary Annuity**

$1,000 payments for 5 years at 6% discount rate:
PV = $1,000 × \[(1 - (1.06)^-5) / 0.06]
PV = $1,000 × \[0.2527 / 0.06] = $1,000 × 4.212 = $4,212.36

---

## **5. Perpetuities**

### **Definition**

A perpetuity is an annuity that continues forever (infinite payments).

### **Present Value of Perpetuity**

$PV = PMT / r$

Where PMT = constant payment, r = discount rate

### **Growing Perpetuity**

$PV = PMT / (r - g)$

Where g = growth rate (must be less than r)

### **Example: Simple Perpetuity**

$100 annual payments forever at 5% discount rate:
PV = $100 / 0.05 = $2,000

### **Example: Growing Perpetuity**

$100 first payment, growing at 2% annually, 8% discount rate:
PV = $100 / (0.08 - 0.02) = $100 / 0.06 = $1,666.67

---

## **6. Continuous Compounding**

### **Definition**

Compounding that occurs continuously rather than at discrete intervals.

### **Formula**

$PV = FV × e^{(-rt)}$

Where e = 2.71828... (Euler's number)

### **Example**

$1,000 in 2 years at 5% continuous rate:
PV = $1,000 × $e^{(-0.05×2)}$ = $1,000 × $e^{(-0.10)}$ = $1,000 × 0.9048 = $904.84

---

## **7. Yield Curves and Term Structure**

### **Definition**

The yield curve shows the relationship between interest rates and time to maturity for bonds of similar credit quality.

### **Types of Yield Curves**

- **Normal (Upward Sloping):** Long-term rates > short-term rates
- **Inverted (Downward Sloping):** Short-term rates > long-term rates
- **Flat:** Similar rates across all maturities

### **Impact on Discounting**

- Use appropriate rates for each time period
- Match the maturity of the discount rate to the cash flow timing
- Adjust for credit risk differences

---

## **8. Practice Problems**

### **Problem 1: Single Cash Flow**

What is the present value of $5,000 received in 4 years at 7% discount rate?

**Solution:** PV = $5,000 / (1.07)^4 = $5,000 / 1.3108 = $3,814.87

### **Problem 2: Annuity**

What is the present value of $2,000 annual payments for 6 years at 9% discount rate?

**Solution:** PV = $2,000 × \[(1 - (1.09)^-6) / 0.09] = $2,000 × 4.4859 = $8,971.90

### **Problem 3: Perpetuity**

What is the present value of $500 annual payments forever at 4% discount rate?

**Solution:** PV = $500 / 0.04 = $12,500

### **Problem 4: Growing Perpetuity**

What is the present value of $1,000 first payment, growing at 3% annually, with 10% discount rate?

**Solution:** PV = $1,000 / (0.10 - 0.03) = $1,000 / 0.07 = $14,285.71

# Bond Pricing

## **1. Bond Basics**

### **Definition**

A bond is a debt security that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). The borrower issues the bond to raise capital and promises to pay back the principal plus interest.

### **Key Components**

- **Face Value (Par Value):** The amount paid back at maturity (usually $1,000)
- **Coupon Rate:** Annual interest rate paid on the face value
- **Coupon Payment:** Periodic interest payment (Face Value × Coupon Rate)
- **Maturity Date:** When the principal is repaid
- **Yield to Maturity (YTM):** Market interest rate for bonds of similar risk
- **Current Price:** What investors pay to buy the bond today

### **Bond Cash Flows**

1. **Periodic coupon payments** during the life of the bond
2. **Principal repayment** at maturity

---

## **2. Basic Bond Pricing Formula**

### **Present Value Approach**

Bond Price = PV of Coupon Payments + PV of Principal

$\text{Bond Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1+r)^t} + \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}$

Where:

- C = Coupon payment per period
- r = Required yield (YTM) per period
- t = Time period (1, 2, 3... n)
- F = Face value
- n = Number of periods to maturity

### **Alternative Formula**

$\text{Bond Price} = C \times \frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} + \frac{F}{(1+r)^n}$

This separates the annuity (coupons) from the lump sum (principal)

---

## **3. Bond Pricing Examples**

### **Example 1: Annual Coupon Bond**

- Face Value: $1,000
- Coupon Rate: 8% annually
- Maturity: 3 years
- Required Yield: 10%

**Solution:**
Annual coupon = $1,000 × 8% = $80

$\text{Bond Price} = \frac{80}{(1.10)^1} + \frac{80}{(1.10)^2} + \frac{80 + 1,000}{(1.10)^3}$

Bond Price = $72.73 + $66.12 + $811.42 = $950.25

### **Example 2: Semi-Annual Coupon Bond**

- Face Value: $1,000
- Coupon Rate: 6% annually (3% semi-annually)
- Maturity: 2 years (4 periods)
- Required Yield: 8% annually (4% semi-annually)

**Solution:**
Semi-annual coupon = $1,000 × 3% = $30

$\text{Bond Price} = \frac{30}{(1.04)^1} + \frac{30}{(1.04)^2} + \frac{30}{(1.04)^3} + \frac{30 + 1,000}{(1.04)^4}$

Bond Price = $28.85 + $27.74 + $26.67 + $879.66 = $962.92

---

## **4. Relationship Between Price and Yield**

### **Key Relationships**

- **When YTM = Coupon Rate:** Bond trades at par (price = face value)
- **When YTM > Coupon Rate:** Bond trades at discount (price < face value)
- **When YTM < Coupon Rate:** Bond trades at premium (price > face value)

### **Inverse Relationship**

- **Yield increases → Price decreases**
- **Yield decreases → Price increases**

### **Example**

10% coupon bond, 5 years maturity, $1,000 face value:

- At 10% YTM: Price = $1,000 (par)
- At 12% YTM: Price = $927.90 (discount)
- At 8% YTM: Price = $1,079.85 (premium)

---

## **5. Zero Coupon Bonds**

### **Definition**

Bonds that pay no periodic interest but are sold at a discount and mature at face value.

### **Pricing Formula**

$\text{Zero Coupon Bond Price} = \frac{\text{Face Value}}{(1 + r)^n}$

### **Example**

- Face Value: $1,000
- Maturity: 5 years
- Required Yield: 8%

$\text{Price} = \frac{1,000}{(1.08)^5} = \frac{1,000}{1.4693} = 680.58$

---

## **6. Bond Yield Calculations**

### **Current Yield**

$$
\text{Current Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Coupon Payment}}{\text{Current Bond Price}}
$$

### **Yield to Maturity (YTM)**

The discount rate that makes the present value of all bond cash flows equal to the current price.

**For YTM calculation, solve:**
$\text{Current Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{C}{(1+\text{YTM})^t} + \frac{F}{(1+\text{YTM})^n}$

### **Example: Current Yield vs YTM**

Bond trading at $950:

- Face Value: $1,000
- Coupon: 8% annually ($80)

$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{80}{950} = 8.42$

YTM will be higher than 8.42 because the bond will appreciate from $950 to $1,000 at maturity

---

## **7. Callable Bonds**

### **Definition**

Bonds that give the issuer the right to redeem the bond before maturity at a predetermined call price.

### **Call Premium**

$\text{Call Premium} = \text{Call Price} - \text{Par Value}$

### **Pricing Callable Bonds**

Use the lower of:

1. **Yield to Maturity calculation**
2. **Yield to Call calculation**

This is called **Yield to Worst**.

---

## **8. Price Sensitivity to Interest Rates**

### **Basic Relationship**

When interest rates change, bond prices move in the opposite direction.

### **Key Factors Affecting Sensitivity**

1. **Time to Maturity:** Longer maturity = higher sensitivity
2. **Coupon Rate:** Lower coupon = higher sensitivity
3. **Yield Level:** Lower yields = higher sensitivity

### **Example**

A 10-year bond is more sensitive to rate changes than a 2-year bond.
A 3% coupon bond is more sensitive than a 8% coupon bond.

---

## **9. Credit Risk and Bond Pricing**

### **Credit Spread**

$\text{Corporate Bond Yield} = \text{Risk-free Rate} + \text{Credit Spread}$

### **Credit Ratings**

- **Investment Grade:** AAA, AA, A, BBB (Moody's: Aaa, Aa, A, Baa)
- **High Yield (Junk):** Below BBB/Baa

### **Default Risk Impact**

Higher default risk → Higher required yield → Lower bond price

---

## **10. Practice Problems**

### **Problem 1: Basic Bond Pricing**

Price a bond with:

- Face value: $1,000
- Coupon rate: 7% annually
- Maturity: 4 years
- Required yield: 9%

**Solution:**
Annual coupon = $70

$\text{Price} = \frac{70}{(1.09)^1} + \frac{70}{(1.09)^2} + \frac{70}{(1.09)^3} + \frac{1,070}{(1.09)^4}$

Price = $64.22 + $58.92 + $54.05 + $757.58 = $934.77

### **Problem 2: Semi-Annual Coupon**

Price a bond with:

- Face value: $1,000
- Coupon rate: 8% annually (4% semi-annually)
- Maturity: 3 years (6 periods)
- Required yield: 6% annually (3% semi-annually)

**Solution:**
Semi-annual coupon = $40

$\text{Price} = \sum_{t=1}^{6} \frac{40}{(1.03)^t} + \frac{1,000}{(1.03)^6}$

Price = $40 × 5.4172 + $837.48 = $216.69 + $837.48 = $1,054.17

### **Problem 3: Zero Coupon Bond**

Price a zero coupon bond with:

- Face value: $1,000
- Maturity: 8 years
- Required yield: 5%

**Solution:**
$\text{Price} = \frac{1,000}{(1.05)^8} = \frac{1,000}{1.4775} = 676.84$

### **Problem 4: Current Yield**

A bond trades at $1,120 with an 8% coupon rate and $1,000 face value.
What is the current yield?

**Solution:**
Annual coupon = $1,000 × 8% = $80

$\text{Current Yield} = \frac{80}{1,120} = 7.14$

### **Problem 5: Bond at Premium vs Discount**

Compare two identical bonds except for their market prices:

- Bond A: Trading at $950 (discount)
- Bond B: Trading at $1,050 (premium)
- Both have 6% coupon, $1,000 face value

**Analysis:**

- Bond A YTM > 6% (trading below par)
- Bond B YTM < 6% (trading above par)
- Bond A offers capital gain at maturity
- Bond B will have capital loss at maturity

### **Problem 6: Credit Spread Calculation**

- 10-year Treasury yield: 3%
- 10-year Corporate bond yield: 5%
- What is the credit spread?

**Solution:**
$\text{Credit Spread} = 5 - 3 = 2$

This 2% represents the additional compensation for taking credit risk.
